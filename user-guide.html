            <h2 id="intro" class="y-target">Introduction</h2>
            <p>Prior to the development of the Ukraine Data Platform, there was no single source of truth or way of viewing the full journey progress (via Super Sponsor or Individual Sponsor Schemes) of people from Ukraine seeking sanctuary in Wales. The Data Platform facilitates secure access to an up to date, single source of data to those providing support to Ukrainian citizens coming into Wales.</p>
            <p>It will help provide an overview of all those entering Wales so that we can easily monitor and support individuals, as well as enable accurate reporting to Welsh Ministers and UK Government.</p>
            <p>We believe this will bring about the following benefits:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Centralised and simplified data:</b> we can gather information on all Ukrainians coming into Wales, using a common set of journey status codes to ensure that we all have the right information at the right time to support them through their journey, and improve information available to staff involved in this work. </li>
                <li><b>Safe and secure:</b> information can be split down by LA, so an individuals’ data and case notes can be controlled by LAs and transferred if they move from one LA to another.</li>
                <li><b>Cross-agency:</b> Each touchpoint to support those in need is recorded. This aids decision making and service/support allocation locally and at Health Board level.</li>
                <li><b>Ease of Reporting:</b> the requirement to report to receive the appropriate funding streams will be much easier with less effort for Local Authorities as Welsh Government will be able to run reports at a national level instead.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This training guide will assist all users requiring access to the data platform, to be able to navigate the system and update information. As future iterations of the data platform are released, this guide will continue to be updated and shared. They will include individuals accessing the system from:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Welsh Government</li>
                <li>Digital Health and Care Wales</li>
                <li>Contact Centre (hosted by Cardiff Local Authority)</li>
                <li>Local Authorities in Wales (including LA staff working in Welcome Centres)</li>
                <li>Local Health Boards in Wales</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="data-statement" class="y-target">Data Statement</h3>
            <p>The Ukraine Data Platform has been developed by the Welsh Government to support the delivery of services to Ukrainian citizens and sponsors resident in Wales under the Welsh Government super-sponsorship, and Homes for Ukraine individual sponsorship schemes only. The data platform contains personal identifiable data. Data disclosure agreements are in place and are regularly reviewed.</p>
            <p>The Welsh Government, local authorities and NHS health boards are all independent data controllers for the data they will access through the platform. Cardiff Council, in its role as the Contact Centre, operates as a Processor under the Welsh Government's instruction.</p>
            <p>By accessing the data platform, you are confirming that you have a valid business reason to access the data and that it will only be used for the agreed purposes.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="summary-of-roles" class="y-target">Summary of roles</h2>
            <h3>Welsh Government</h3>
            <p>The Welsh Government has multiple responsibilities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Defining the policies that support the Homes for Ukraine scheme in Wales.</li>
                <li>Receiving and processing the UK Gov data onto platform.</li>
                <li>Producing the reports and statistics required by Senedd ministers and UK Government.</li>
                <li>All system security matters.</li>
                <li>Developing the platform, to help with workload processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In terms of the platform the Welsh Government are the product and service owners.</p>
            <h3>Local Authorities</h3>
            <p>Numerous local authority services will be required by individuals and groups that have travelled from Ukraine, including housing provision (where an individual has arrived through the Super Sponsor Scheme) and facilitating conversations between hosts and those looking for accommodation and checks of accommodation (through Individual Sponsor Scheme). They also provide access to statutory services such as education and social services. The system will facilitate improved data sharing between approved organisations to ensure individuals receive the services and housing that meet their needs.</p>
            <h3>Contact Centres</h3>
            <p>Operating from Cardiff Council, but providing a service to the whole of Wales, a team of 70+ staff are responsible for initiating travel of Ukrainians to Wales. They prepare households for their journey, capture individual needs, capture housing need, allocate them a space at a Welcome Centre, track them in transit and coordinate transport to welcome centres where they are supported by local authority staff. They have access to the data of all applicants until they arrive at the Welcome Centre.  The Contact Centre do not liaise or input data for anyone coming through the individual route.</p>
            <h3>Arrival Hubs</h3>
            <p>Under the Super Sponsor scheme, Arrival Hubs liaise with the Contact Centre to ensure Ukrainians travelling to Welcome Centres are guided to their onward transport. In Wales, the arrival hubs are Holyhead and Pembroke Dock Ports, Cardiff Airport and Wrexham and Cardiff Central stations.</p>
            <h3>Welcome Centres</h3>
            <p>Operated mainly by local authorities with support from local providers (hoteliers/third sector organisations), these centres provide temporary accommodation to new arrivals through the Super Sponsor Scheme and connection with any support they require to access medical care, education and financial assistance. The Welcome Centres also coordinate the transfer of new arrivals when suitable permanent accommodation is found.  Welcome Centres do not house individuals that have arrived through the Individual Sponsor Route.</p>
            <h3>Local Health Boards</h3>
            <p>Operating through Public Health Wales and the Local Authorities, the Local Health Boards provide medical support for those arriving from the Ukraine. In some cases, the NHS will be in contact with applicants and/or medical staff before the person arrives in the UK to ensure the right level of support and care is in-place for their arrival.</p>

            <h2 id="accessing-live-system" class="y-target">Accessing the Live Data Platform</h2>
            <h3>Registering for an account</h3>
            <p>Before you can access the HfU Data Platform, you need to have registered for access.</p>
            <p>To register for an account:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contact your local Ukraine Data Platform Data Champion with details of your Microsoft 365 account.</li>
                <li>Your Data Champion will consider your request and if approved, will request an account be set up for you using your Microsoft 365 account details.</li>
                <li>Once your account has been set up, you will receive a notification from the Welsh Government that your account is ready to be accessed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are unsure whether you have an account set up, please check with your Local Data Champion before trying to access the system.</p>
            <p><b>Please note:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Welsh Government will only accept requests for new accounts that come via your Data Champion</li>
                <li>Before setting up a new Data Champion / user, the Welsh Government will require confirmation from the requesting Data Champion that they have trained the new champion(s) and that they have full knowledge of how to use the platform and obtain support.</li>
                <li>You <b>will not</b> receive a username and password – please follow the instructions below to access the system for the first time.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Accessing the Live System for the first time</h3>
            <p>You can access the Live system using the following information</p>
            <ol>
                <li>1.	Open a browser and paste the following URL into the address bar and click return: https://homesforukrainedataplatform.crm11.dynamics.com/</li>
                <li>2.	You will be asked to log in with your Microsoft 365 account details.</li>
                <li>3.	Once prompted you will need to use Microsoft Authenticate to verify you as a user. If you are not currently using Microsoft Authenticate, please see below for further information on downloading and using the application.</li>
                <li>4.	When the Platform opens, a Home Screen may appear. Select ‘Homes for Ukraine’ app.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you experience problems logging in, please refer to the <a href="support-model.html">Support Model</a>.</p>
            <p><b>Important:</b></p>
            <p>Do not share your login details to the system or authenticate another user on their behalf.</p>
            <p>Do not use the live system to deliver any training. Training should be done in the Test System (<a href="https://org616cc293.crm11.dynamics.com/">https://org616cc293.crm11.dynamics.com/</a>)</p>
            <p>To help differentiate between the Live (Prod) and Dev systems, the banners are different colours.</p>
            <p>Live Platform: Purple</p>
            <p>Test platform: Orange</p>
            <h3>Using Multi Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
            <p>Multi-factor authentication is a process in which users are prompted for an additional form of identification during sign-in. The additional form of identification is usually a code or biometric login through their mobile phone.</p>
            <p>A second form of identification makes it harder for attackers to obtain or duplicate your log in details. It is therefore mandatory that MFA is used to access the platform.  You can use either a personal phone, work phone or tablet to authenticate your access to the data platform.</p>
            <p>You can do this in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><b>Download the Microsoft Authenticator app.</b> The app plays no other role on your phone than helping you log into the platform when you require access. We have published detailed instructions on <a href="#app">how to use the Microsoft Authenticator app</a> to access the Homes for Ukraine data platform.</li>
                <li><b>Use Microsoft Authenticator to request a code</b> sent by SMS text message to your phone. If you prefer this method, follow our alternative guide for <a href="#sms">how to use Microsoft Authenticate SMS</a> to validate your access.</li>

            <h3 id="welcome-centre-checks" class="y-target">Welcome Centre Checks</h3>
            <p>When a person or household group arrives at a Welcome Centre, there are several checks that need to take place before they are ready to be matched to suitable accommodation. These are grouped into three checklists:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Initial Check in</li>
                <li>2nd Stage checks (usually relatively close to the initial checking in)</li>
                <li>3rd and Final check</li>
            </ol>
            <p>There are 2 places to update an individual’s record to show the checks that have taken place.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Case Notes and Activities</li>
                <li>Check Box</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Both are under the Summary tab within an individual's record.</p>
            <p><b>Please note:</b></p>
            <p>Once the checks are finalised, we will build these into the system, however this is the best way to update records in the interim.</p>
            <h4>Initial 'Check in' Check</h4>
            <p>Ideally completed as soon as an individual reaches the contact centre or emergency accommodation the initial checks list focus on immediate health requirements and getting them settled. </p>
            <p>Check list items are: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Meet any immediate needs (medical, essential supplies). If any medical needs, contact local healthcare team or 111 if further advice needed. </li>
                <li>Offer Covid test (not compulsory but advised). If positive, alert healthcare worker. </li>
                <li>Allocate room.  </li>
                <li>Provide a Welcome Centre information pack and tour of facilities. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>After this check you will need to <a href="#creating-placement-record">create a placement record</a> which will include the room allocated during this initial check.</p>
            <h4>2nd Stage Checks</h4>
            <p>During the 2nd you will need to create another case note or several case notes to cover the process of offering these aspects of health and financial support. Not all delivery partners will have access to the system, so consider how you will share information with them. <a href="#navigation">Using excel to export the data may be a useful option</a>.</p>
            <ol start="5">
                <li>Book individual/family health appointment with health team. </li>
                <li>Refer for DWP support. </li>
                <li>Refer to casework team if immediate financial support is required.  </li>
                <li>Offer new mobile SIM card if required. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>To do so, follow the steps below to create a new case note. Again, you may want to copy the checklist (numbered 5 to 8) to indicate which checks have been carried out. </p>
            <p><b>Please note:</b> if a new SIM card is provided, ensure the number is added to the “Preferred number” field within Person Information in the Summary tab.</p>
            <h4>3rd and Final checks prior</h4>
            <p>The following checks will need to be completed before an applicant can be considered for matching to available accommodation through the Super Sponsor Scheme. </p>
            <ol start="9">
                <li>Assistance offered to open a bank account.  </li>
                <li>Offer ESOL language classes. </li>
                <li>Arrange attendance at cultural briefing session.  </li>
                <li>Adults: refer to Working Wales for employment/ training support. </li>
                <li>Children: Arrange immediate education and early years provision. </li>
                <li>Signpost to biometric data registration with Home Office.</li>
                <li>Check accommodation needs haven’t changed.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><a href="#create-case-note">Create a case note</a> to record that these checks have been completed and change the checks box as appropriate.  </p>
            <p>At this point you will also need to check that the accommodation needs of the household have not changed. </p>
            <p>When these checks/services have been offered or provided, you can <a href="#change-journey-status">change the journey status</a> from SS07 – SS08 Welcome Centre Ready for Move On.  That will then enable local authorities to assess the housing need of individuals in the Welcome Centre who have had checks completed against available accommodation. </p>
            <h3 id="sponsor-host-checks" class="y-target">Sponsor / host checks</h3>
                <p>The sponsor or prospective Host (EOI) and their property should be checked prior to arrival, or very shortly after, a person or household are matched to them. The sponsor check box (shown below) can be used to track when a check has been carried out.  The two checks with padlocks will be provided the DLUHC data feeds and only apply to Sponsors, who have sponsored an application.</p>
                <p>The checks should be toggled on the data platform once completed and include:</p>
                <img src="assets/images/moveon/sponsor-checks.png" alt="Screenshot of sponsor checks list">
                <p><b>Introductory Contact Made –</b> The LA has reached out to the host to make introductions, confirm they are still happy to host, provide all necessary information regarding the hosting and ensure they are prepared.   </p>
                <p><b>Consent for DBS –</b> within the introductory contact the host should provide consent to start the DBS process, this will then either be completed by the individual or by the LA as per local processes. </p>
                <p><b>Basic DBS Check Completed -</b> to ensure that the Basic DBS check has been completed.</p>
                <p><b>Enhanced DBS Check Completed -</b> to ensure that the Enhanced DBS check (if required) has been completed.</p>
                <p><b>Please note:</b> only one DBS check needs to be completed, this is at the discretion of each LA as to which one, however it is recommended that an enhanced check be completed if the host is willing to house families with children or vulnerable adults. </p>
                <p><b>Sponsor checks only:</b> As part of the application process, a <b>sponsor</b> may be rejected by the home office if they fail their <b>PNC (Police National Computer services)</b> or <b>Home Office Warnings Index Checks.</b> This will be recorded in the data platform under a locked field on the sponsor record and will be read only for information only. It will be the Home Office’s responsibility to rematch the applicant to a suitable sponsor for their application, this will also show in the sponsor checks section under <b>Home Office Rematching</b> as a read only checkbox for information only.</p>

                <h3 id="host-address-check" class="y-target">Host Address Related Checks </h3>
                <p>The Host Address section has had some small changes made to ensure accurate data capture.  On each host address record, you will see the housing inspection checkbox: </p>
                <img src="assets/images/moveon/housing-inspection.png" alt="Screenshot of housing inspection completed toggle in the yes position">
                <p><b>Housing Inspection Check - </b>to ensure the property is suitable and meets the correct criteria to host applicants.</p>
                <p>This has been removed from the Sponsor/Host section and will now sit on each individual host address record.  The toggle will need completed for each individual property that the sponsor/host has offered once the checks have been confirmed successful.</p>
            <h3 id="bulk-updates-checks" class="y-target">Bulk updates to checks</h3>
            <p>There is a table within each household record which lists the members of the household and which checks they have undergone in the Welcome Centre. When several members of a household group have each undergone the same checks (such as having a family health appointment booked or welfare visit completed), you can quickly update these checks in a single location to save time. </p>
            <p>You can also use this table to see which members of a merged household (a reunited family for example) have had checks and which individuals have not. </p>
            <p>To update all of the records at the same time:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on the Household ID for the person or group you wish to update.</li>
                <li>Click on the Super Sponsor / Individual Sponsor Applicant Checks button in the top menu (depending on which sponsorship scheme the person is on).</li>

            <h3 id="using-case-notes" class="y-target">Using case notes</h3>
            <p>You will need to create a case note to record any checks which have been completed and add any additional information. To do this: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Change your system view and filter this view further if you prefer. You can read more about changing system views under the <a href="#system-views">System Views section</a> of this guide.</li>

            <h4>Tips for adding information into the Case Notes and Activities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide as much detail as possible BUT do not include any health/sensitive information.  For example, you could say a medical check has been booked/completed but not information about the outcome. </li>
                <li>Do not delete a record unless it has been added in error. You can annotate it has been completed or if a task or appointment mark as complete using to tick icon which appears when you hover over a record. </li>
                <li>You can create a Task, but you are not able to assign tasks to other team members. </li>
                <li>You are only able to update your own case notes. </li>
                <li>The system is not designed for document upload.</li>

            <h3 id="adding-complex-case-flag" class="y-target">Adding a Complex Case flag</h3>
            <p>A complex case flag can be applied to individual applicants’ records. This is used when an applicant may have a complex health or personal circumstance which may mean they should be supported differently. </p>
            <p>A complex case flag creates a pop-up message that appears whenever the applicant’s record is accessed to notify the platform user of the complex case. </p>
            <p>It is vital that the privacy of the applicant is protected. Therefore, any information outlining their circumstances must be held on local systems. A case note should be added to the platform identifying the person or team to speak to for further information. </p>

            <p>An applicant may make contact to state they don’t want to receive any communication, however it is necessary that essential communications are still carried out.  This means they should only receive information from Welsh Government regarding their current sponsor/hosting position.  Restricting their communication preferences to essential communication only means they will stop receiving updates regarding things such as Ukrainian National holiday updates/ information on local Ukrainian events etc.</p>

            <h2 id="the-move-on-process" class="y-target">The Move on Process</h2>
            <p>The move-on process has become the key focus of the Ukraine programme. In closing Initial Accommodation (IA) and Welcome Centres (WC) the overarching aim is to move people from WC/IA accommodation to longer term accommodation including hosted accommodation. We are also looking to place new applicant arrivals directly into hosted accommodation to reduce use of initial accommodation.</p>
                <p>There is now a more definitive need to incorporate the move on process into the UDP and by doing so will reduce data duplication, provide a more consistent approach to managing move-on, make processes easier and will provide us with a complete single source of the truth.</p>
                <p>The new process, as such, will remain quite like the current process: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>EOI offers will need to be triaged by the local authority. </li>
                    <li>All standard housing and DBS checks will need to be completed.</li>
                    <li>Once checks have successfully been completed the property will be made available to all LA’s when searching.</li>
                    <li>LA’s will be able to locate properties based on the criteria set out in the housing need for each household.</li>
                    <li>A property can be reserved by any LA and once reserved, becomes unavailable to others that are using the move on search function. </li>
                    <li>Once matching has been completed a placement tracking will be auto created.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>New processes that will be introduced following the move into the UDP (on 5th July 2023) will be as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There will be no requirement to upload the EOI manually into the UDP and you will not be required to enter data previously received via Objective Connect (this will be made Read Only) .  All EOI’s that come through the Welsh Government Homes for Ukraine smart survey will be automatically uploaded via a data load.</li>
                    <li>The LA will be responsible for inputting information into a new ‘offered property’ tab which will help aid the search functionality. </li>
                    <li>The new search functionality will ensure that only one property can be reserved at a time.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Please Note:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EOI’s that are matched outside of the smart survey, usually as a result of self-matching will still have to be manually uploaded to the platform.</li>
                    <li>The move on process will also amalgamate <b>all</b> available hosts – not just EOI’s.  This means that when a household leaves their hosted accommodation and the host is still willing to host another family, the LA can recycle this record to be used within the reservation process on the move on search tab. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 id="contact-centre" class="y-target">LA / Contact Centre Responsibilities for the Move On Process</h3>
                <p>Both the contact centre and each respective LA will have responsibilities within the UDP to ensure that the move on process runs smoothly.</p>
                <h4>Contact Centre Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>The Contact Centre’s responsibility within the move on process is to ensure that direct allocations for Super Sponsor applicants runs smoothly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overarching concept of direct allocation to hosts includes allocating arrivals through the Welsh Government Super Sponsor Scheme to hosts prior to their arrival in Wales.  People will travel directly to hosts on arrival in the UK rather than placed in initial accommodation. Directly allocating people reduces the demand on initial accommodation and the need for local authorities to move people on from initial accommodation.  </li>
                    <li>The Contact Centre will identify available host offers via the move on search.  They will then liaise with local authorities to coordinate the direct allocations and matching people to suitable hosts. People will not be directly allocated to a host by the Contact Centre without the agreement of the receiving local authority.  The intention is to directly allocate all new arrivals to hosts where suitable host offers are identified.  People will be offered initial accommodation in the form of a Welcome Centre or holiday park where a suitable host is not available.    </li>
                    <li>The Contact Centre will liaise between hosts and guests regarding arrival and travel to Wales.  The contact centre will also manage the reservation process via the UDP to ensure that household records are linked and moved to the owning Local Authority of the new host / host address once the reservation process has been completed. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Local Authority Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>Each local authority will need to ensure that they have completed the following.</p>
                <p>For Households/Applicants:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every Household within their LA has a completed Housing Need Tab.</li>
                    <li>When a person joins or leaves the household the Housing Need Tab is updated to reflect the new household set up.</li>
                    <li>The household timeline is updated with any important (but non sensitive) notes regarding the household. </li>
                    <li>When actioning the move on search the LA must do this from the household tab and should consider the household needs when filtering their search. </li>
                    <li>When a property has been reserved the LA must liaise with the host address Local Authority (if this is different to their own)</li>
                    <li>When a property has been reserved, process the reservation through the stages, via the reservation status dropdowns, until the match is complete – regardless of whether the property is in your LA or not.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For sponsors/hosts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For every Sponsor or host (EOI), all sponsor and household checks must be completed and toggled before the property is made available in the move on search.</li>
                    <li>Keep track of each reserved property within your LA (by means a of a view)</li>
                    <li>Keep track of any hosts and host addresses that become available after their applicants have vacated to conduct a triage call for potential further hosting responsibilities (accessed by means of a view)</li>
                    <li>Liaise with LAs who reserve one of your properties for their household – to arrange meetings and travel. </li>
                </ul>
            <h3 id="offered-property-tab" class="y-target">Offered Property Tab</h3>
                <p>The offered property tab sits within the host address section as a separate tab.  This tab contains anonymised data and a partial postcode, to ensure that other LA’s access relevant data only.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the offered property tab is to document the details of the property being offered, so that the Household property search shows viable properties only.</p>
                <p>It is very important that this information is kept up to date and accurate to ensure that property searches across the board become successful reservations/matches. </p>
                <p>The tab will include the following information, please complete the fields as required. Those marked with a red asterisk (*) are mandatory:</p>
                <img src="assets/images/moveon/offered-property.png" alt="Screenshot of host address screen in the offered property tab">
                <p>An offered property tab will appear automatically on any EOI data or when an additional address is added to a record. Existing sponsor records within the system that have an active hosting will still have an offered property tab but this will be empty and show ‘Source record not selected’: </p>
                <img src="assets/images/moveon/offered-property2.png" alt="Screenshot of host address screen in the offered property tab with Source record not selected message">
                <p>Once the current placement ends and the host address becomes available, the offered property status will revert to ‘Pending Checks’, and a blank offered property form will generate in the offered property tab.  It will be your responsibility to communicate with the host to enquire if they wish to host another family.  If they do, all previous checks should be confirmed to still be valid before making changing the offered property status to available.</p>
                <p><b>Please note: </b>If the host no longer wishes to house any new applicants, then their records need to be set to withdrawn and this will automatically set the offered property tab to removed. </p>
                <p>To view all offered properties in your area you will need to access the Offered Properties tab via the left have navigation:</p>

        <p>The completed match process (setting the status to RS07- Move on match complete with the start date) will link the host and household together on the host section of the household tab.  It will create a placement tracking on the household, applicant and sponsor records and will move the household into the new LA (if the household is moving from one LA to another).  To confirm this has processed correctly you can go back into the household record and into placement tracking’s and view the new placement tracking records.

    <p>If you are creating a placement tracking for any other option other than ‘sponsor/host’ for example ‘move on accommodation’ this will not pull through the host details into the placement tracking.

        <p>This may be due to the individuals repatriating or relocating.  The system will prevent the PT from being created until the reservation has been closed.  The below error message will appear: </p>
        <img src="assets/images/moveon/error.png" alt="Screenshot of error message explaining that You need first to close the reservation before you can create move on placement tracking outside Wales">
        <p>The reason this is blocked is to stop open reservations from being left in the system.  If a reservation has fallen through because the household has decided to leave Wales this should be set to RS08 – match unsuccessful and the status reason, be set to ‘property reserved in error’ before a PT repatriation or move on (with England or Scotland as the LA) PT is created on the household.</p>
        <h3 id="other-placement" class="y-target">Other Placement Types</h3>
        <h4>If Sponsor/Host PT is selected</h4>
        <p>If a sponsor/host Placement type is selected whilst there is an active reservation, the system will prevent the PT from being created: </p>
        <img src="assets/images/moveon/warning.png" alt="Screenshot of warning message stating that In order to create placement tracking from the type sponsor/host please create a reservation">
        <p>This is because the reservation process should be followed to create a sponsor/host PT. </p>
        <p><b>Please note:</b></p>
        <p>If there is a host already attached to the household (from a previous/ current placement) then until the reservation is set to 'Matched' - RS02 – RS06, a host/ sponsor placement tracking will still be able to be created but will link to the current host linked to the household page.  Once the status is reflected to show the host / household as matched, the above error will appear preventing a PT from being created until the reservation process has been successfully completed.</p>
        <h4>If there is no active reservation</h4>
        <p>If the reservation process hasn’t been started but there is a host attached to the household (from previous data load) and no PT has yet been created, the system will allow this to be created to reflect the current hosted placement.  </p>
        <p>When the time comes for the host to be changed, the reservation process should be followed. </p>
        <h4>If any other PT is selected</h4>
        <p>If any of the below PTs are created whilst a reservation is in place, the system will allow the PT to be created provided that the local authority is within Wales:</p>
        <ul><li>Hospital</li>
        <li>Move on accomodation</li>
        <li>Temporary accomodation</li>
        <li>Welcome Centre</li>
        <li>Temporarily Left</li></ul>
        <p>You should only need to create these placement tracking’s in emergency situations where someone needs to be relocated prior to the reservation process being completed.  </p>
        <p>If you are creating a placement tracking for a more permanent move that is not a host/sponsor placement created via the reservation process, you should close the active reservation <b>before</b>creating the PT. </p>
            <h3 id="create-historic-placement-tracking" class="y-target">Creating a historical Placement Tracking</h3>
            <p>There may be a requirement to create historical placement tracking record for the period of time where applicants had arrived into Wales but the UDP was not yet set up.</p>
            <p>The ability to add a historic placement tracking will allow the Local Authority to create placement tracking’s with dates created prior to the first placement tracking for the household.  It will be the LAs responsibility to input any historic placement tracking’s for households who remain within the same Local Authority.  For households that no longer live in the same Local Authority as their original placement – it will be the responsibility of the Contact Centre to input historical placement tracking’s on these records, due to them having access to all Welsh LA data. The contact centre will liaise with the previous LA to ensure the information inputted is correct.</p>
            <p><b>IMPORTANT:  when inputting multiple historic placement tracking’s, it’s really important that you start by creating the most recent historic placement first and then work your way back to the first placement.  As the end date is locked you need to work backwards from newest to oldest placements.</b></p>
            <p>To create a historic placement tracking:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Go into the household record and select placement tracking’s.</li>
                <li>Referring to the screenshot below, to create a historic placement tracking the date needs to precede the start date of the first placement tracking – in this example it would need to be a date prior to 04/01/23.</li>
                <img src="assets/images/historical_tracking23.png" alt="Placement Tracking menu showing the 4th of January 2023 as the Date Started">
                <li>Select new placement tracking and complete all fields, the placement type selected should reflect what the placement type was at the time of the historic placement.</li>
                <li>When you input the start date you will get a warning message that you are about to create a historic placement tracking.</li>
                <img src="assets/images/new_historical23.png" alt="Menu prompt advising that you are going to submit a historical record" width="50%" height="50%">
                <li>Select ok and create the placement tracking inputting all relevant information:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>if the placement was for a Welcome Centre you need to ensure you input the correct welcome centre into the allocated welcome centre field.</li>
                        <li>if the placement was for a sponsor/host you need to ensure you link the host and host address relevant to that placement.</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Save and close the PT.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>	Please note:  there is no system functionality behind historic placement tracking’s so this will not link the welcome centre or sponsor/host and will also not move the record (if the previous placement was in another LA).</p>

            <p>For scenarios where an active applicant has passed away, it is important that certain actions are carried out within the data platform to ensure that the record is set to the correct journey status and that the record is removed from ‘active’ views.</p>
            <p>It is important that this process is carried out to prevent any communication being sent to family members and causing further distress.</p>
            <p>The process to handle deceased applicant records is as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the applicant into their own household (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Add a note to the applicant timeline to explain the person has passed away.  No details other than the date of death will need to be recorded <b>(no sensitive or medical information to be included)</b></li>
                <li>Raise a ticket with Jira to make them aware of the death.</li>
                <li>Set the applicant Journey status to IS12 – Support Ended / SS07 – Support Ended  </li>
                <li>Set the Status Reason to ‘Deceased’ </li>
                <li>Toggle ‘No Non-Essential Communications’ to <b>YES</b></li>
                <li>Email the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a>  mailbox to advise that the applicant has passed away and the above actions have been completed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The WG team will then deactivate the record.  If needed, you will be able to access this via the ‘inactive applicants’ view.</p>

            <p>There will be times where households need to be re-matched to alternative accommodation. This may be for several reasons including the scheduled end of a placement; placement breakdown; and movement to be closer to friends or family – amongst other reasons.</p>
            <p>Re-matching process is the same for individuals, irrelevant of the scheme through which they travelled to Wales.</p>
            <p>The process for re-matching will depend on the nature of the re-match in question. Depending on the scenario, some elements of ‘rematching’ will be referred to as Re-assignment.  There are broadly four categories:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Re-match within the individual local authority boundary</li>
                <li>Re-assignment across local authority boundaries but wholly within Wales</li>
                <li>Cross Border Re-assignment across UK national borders (e.g., from a local authority in Wales to a local authority in England – or vice versa)</li>
                <li>Re-match from a super sponsor route to a host across a UK national boundary.</li>

            <p>If you are aware of a household (individual/family/group) that requires re-matching you will need to identify a host (either via the Ukrainian themselves, through the Expression of Interest data and the <a href="user-guide.html#the-move-on-process">move on process</a>, or via other means)</p>
            <p>To identify a possible host::</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Review existing sponsors that are/have hosted individuals through the Homes for Ukraine Sponsor Scheme. This can be done within the data platform.  If a suitable host is identified – the <a href="user-guide.html#offered-property-tab">offered property tab</a> will need to be updated / completed and the <a href="user-guide.html#the-move-on-process">move on process</a> is followed</li>
                <li>Review those that have offered accommodation through the Super Sponsor Scheme. This will need to be done using the Expressions of Interest data shared directly into the UDP from the Smart Survey results.  Once checks have been completed for these EOI’s they will need to be made available in order to form part of the move on process</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="rematch-within-boundary" class="y-target">Re-match within the individual local authority boundary</h3>
            <p>If you can facilitate a local re-match, there is no need for another local authority’s agreement nor notification to the UK Government. If you are able to-match with a sponsor of another Ukrainian household who has travelled under the Homes for Ukraine Scheme, you will find their details in the system and will need to link the records of both the Sponsor and the household that requires re-matching.</p>
            <p>If you have found a suitable host from the EoI data generated through the Super Sponsor Scheme, you will need to follow the move on and reservation process to ensure the record shows as a viable host in the UDP.  </p>
            <p>If you have found a suitable host outside of the smart survey results (i.e. they have come to you directly) you will need toundertake the following steps on the data platform to record the re-match and ensure appropriate property, DBS and safeguarding checks are completed for the new host and where necessary other family members living with them.</p>
            <p>Within the Home for Ukraine Data Platform, you will need to</p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="user-guide.html#adding-new-sponsor">Add a New Host</a> within the Sponsor section of the data platform</li>
                <li><a href="user-guide.html#adding-host-addresses">Add the host property address</a></li>
                <li><a href="user-guide.html#offered-property-tab">Complete the offered property tab</a></li>
                <li>Follow the <a href="user-guide.html#the-move-on-process">move on process</a> and <a href="user-guide.html#reservation-process">reservation process</a></li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Matching within the same LA</h4>
            <p>If the household and host both reside in your local authority, then the match process will mirror the reservation process: </p>
            <ol><li>Find a suitable host by using the move on search.</li>
            <li>Reserve the host.</li>
            <li>Follow and complete the reservation process.</li>
            <li>Ensure all necessary timeline notes have been created.</li>
            <li>Set the reservation status to RS07- Move on match complete.</li>
            <li>Set the start date as the first day of the new placement.</li>
        <li>Click Save or Save & Close.</li></ol>
        <p>Once the match process is completed successfully a placement tracking for ‘Sponsor/host’ will be created and will create the link between the host and household.  The new host details replace any existing host details on the household and applicant records and the creation of the new placement tracking will close any previous placement tracking’s associated with these records. </p>
        <p>If you are creating a placement tracking for any other option other than ‘sponsor/host’ for example ‘move on accommodation’ this will not pull through the host details into the placement tracking.

            <p>The key difference between matching and this process is the need for local authorities to get the agreement of the onward destination local authority before processing the transfer on the Ukraine Data Platform. The Ukraine Data Platform does not permit full access to all records for every local authority. Only the records of those linked to an area can be viewed by the relevant local authority. Therefore, if a visa holder moves to a new local authority a re-assignment process must take place to ensure data transfers appropriately. This can be actioned by following the reservation process.  The move on search will allow Local Authorities to see partially anonymised host/host address data to enable them to re match applicants to new hosts by following the <a href="#reservation-process">reservation process.</a></p>
           <p>Once the property has been reserved and the re-match has been agreed between both local authorities, <b>the original local authority</b> (where a household is already placed) will need to:</p>

            <p>There will be times when a Ukrainian household chooses to return to the Ukraine to live or visit for an extended period. When a household leaves their accommodation for more than 2 weeks, local authorities can reallocate their accommodation to another family in need.  Due to the volatile nature within Ukraine, families that had repatriated without plans to come back may choose to return to Wales.  </p>
            <p>Ideally a family will inform you of their decision in advance, but you may not know this has happened until they return, seeking accommodation.  </p>
            <p>It is important that placement tracking records show the individual has left the UK and returned for funding purposes and you may therefore need to complete these retrospectively.</p>

                <li>Save the record.</li>

            <p><b>Please note: </b>If the host no longer wishes to house any new applicants, then their records need to be set to withdrawn and this will automatically set the offered property tab to removed. </p>

            <p>On some occasions you will need to replace an existing host/sponsor with another within the current local authority. </p>
            <p>If the host is being replaced:</p>
            <ol>
               <li>Firstly, you must ensure the housing needs tab is up to date for the household. </li>
               <li>When searching for a new suitable host you will need to access the move on search tab.</li>
               <li>Complete the reservation process through to RS08- match completed successfully. ).</li>
               <li>An automatic placement tracking will be created and the host details will appear on the household general page.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Hosts with multiple properties will show as available if they have any available properties – only the available properties will show in the  move on search list.</p>
            <p>As the host section on the household page is locked you can only replace a host with an alternative host via the move on search and reservation process.</p>
           
            <p>To remove a host completely (because the person is moving to self-supporting within the LA for instance) you need to create a placement tracking with a dropdown of any scenario other than sponsor/host:</p>
            <img src="assets/images/dropdown-nohost23.png" alt="Drop down menu with sponsor/host striked through">
            <p>Once a placement tracking has been created with one of the above dropdowns, the host will be automatically removed from the household page and the host section will no longer be a mandatory field. </p>

            <h3 id="remove-household-no-show" class="y-target">Removing a Host/Sponsor when the household is a No Show</h3>
            <p>There will be occasions where a household has decided either not to travel to Wales, has decided not to use this Visa or has travelled to another part of the UK on a separate Homes for Ukraine Visa.  There may also be a situation where the household/applicant are uncontactable with no confirmed arrival date. </p>
            <p>On these occasions, there may be a host still linked to the household page, which is a result of a flow that was run in release 4.0.  As the host / host address field is mandatory and locked on the household page and you cannot create a placement tracking for someone who hasn’t arrived, it’s important that the IS Journey Status is reflective of the situation to enable the deletion of the data in these mandatory fields. </p>
            <p>The system has functionality that when ALL members of a household group are set to No show / uncontactable it will remove the mandatory restrictions behind the host/ host address section of the household page.</p>
            <p>When a household (multiple applicants or single applicants) are no shows, you should:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Set the IS Journey Status to one of 3 options: IS21, IS22, IS23.</li>
                <img src="assets/images/is_journey23.png" alt="list of IS codes available (IS21, IS22 and IS23)" width="60%" height="60%">
                <li>Ensure that this is set for ALL members of the household.</li>
                <li>The system will automatically remove the host details from the locked fields on the household page (after about 30-40 seconds) </li>
            </ol>
            <P>The host/host address fields will now be empty, the link between sponsor/host and applicant will be removed and the sponsor/host will now become available. The offered property status will also revert back to pending checks to enable you to start the triage process for move on, if relevant. </P>
            <P>Please note: if not all members of the household are no show’s then you will need to split the household removing the no show applicants into their own household group.</P>

            <h3 id="recording-additional" class="y-target">Recording additional sponsor household members</h3>

            <p>Many Ukrainians have applied on several visa schemes in order to seek sanctuary in Wales and the UK. If they have had a visa approved for more than one scheme, the data in the platform may reflect this, appearing as duplicate records. </p>
            <p>It may be clear to you which sponsorship scheme a person is travelling on, for example if they arrive at a Welcome Centre (super sponsor) or if they have their own sponsor (Individual Sponsor). If it is not clear, you can ask the individual to confirm which scheme they are travelling on, or you can ask to check their application number on any emails or documentation they have brought with them.</p>
            <p>When you have established which application is the duplicate, take the following steps to mark out the duplicate record and separate it from any existing household groups:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make a note of the application number of the duplicate record. In the true record, add a case note and include the duplicate application number for future reference. </li>
                <li>Open the applicant’s duplicate record on the Summary section.</li>

            <h3 id="rejected-sponsors" class="y-target">Rejected or Withdrawn Sponsors / Hosts</h3>
            <p>There may be occasions where a sponsor/host wishes to withdraw their interest in hosting or is rejected as a result of failed checks, such as local government/ property checks.</p>
            <p>If a host expresses that they wish to ‘withdraw’ from the scheme or is ‘rejected’ as a result of failed checks the record will need to be set to the correct sponsor journey status in order for the system to deactivate their records.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/sponsor-journey23.png" alt="Menu showing the selection to make under sponsor journey.">
            <p>Once selected the system will automatically deactivate these records to prevent them from showing up on the active sponsors list.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will still have the ability to create case notes on the record once deactivated.</li>
                <li>The offered property tab for the host address will also become inactive and the offered property status will change to ‘removed’ </li>
                <li>If you need to access a withdrawn / rejected sponsor record – you can locate these via the inactive sponsor’s view: </li>

            <h3 id="reinstate-host" class="y-target">To reinstate a withdrawn host </h3>
            <p>If a host who has previously withdrawn from their responsibilities to host reaches out to state, they wish to begin hosting again you will need to obtain access of the previously deactivated sponsor/host record.</p>
            <p>As local authorities don’t have access to reactivate records, data champions will need to contact the UDP team via the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> mailbox to request that the sponsor record be reinstated to an active status.  Please include in your request:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The name of the sponsor</li>
                <li>The action to be taken – status changed from HST004-withdrawn to HST003-Active</li>
                <li>A brief description that the sponsor has wished to resume their status as a host </li>
            </ol>
            <p>The UDP team with then reactivate the sponsor/ host record and the offered property record.  The offered property status will be changed to pending checks and it will be your responsibility to ensure that all sponsor/host checks are still relevant before making the property available within the <a href="user-guide.html#the-move-on-process">move on</a> search. </p>


            <h3 id="duplicate-host-no-approved" class="y-target">Duplicate Hosts with no approved applicants attached</h3>
            <p>From time to time you may come across an additional host record.  These will usually have no linked applicants or PTs attached.</p>
            <p>It will normally show an application linked with no applicant name which suggests that the applicant has not yet been approved.</p>
            <img src="assets/images/duplicate-hosts23.png" alt="Image showing application screen with no applicant">
            <p>To avoid having multiple records in the system for hosts/sponsors you can deactivate these by selecting their sponsor/host journey status to HST006 – Duplicate. </p>
            <p>The record will be automatically de-activated</p>
            <img src="assets/images/hst00623.png" alt="Sponsor page showing HST006 selected">
            <p>IMPORTANT: these records should only be deactivated if there is a live active record for the sponsor/host already in the system.</p>
            <p>If this is a new sponsor/host record with multiple duplicates linked to different blank (unapproved) applications, these will need to be kept active until the applications have been approved.  This is due to the likelihood that the individual applicants will for a household group once approved and the duplicated sponsor records will be automatically deactivated as part of the deduplication process at data load. </p>
            <p>If you need to access a Deactivated sponsor record – you can locate these via the inactive sponsors view:</p>

            <p>A sponsor/host may make contact to state they don’t want to receive any communication, however it is necessary that essential communications are still carried out. This means they should only receive information from Welsh Government regarding their current sponsor/hosting position.  Restricting their communication preferences to essential communication only means they will stop receiving updates regarding things such as Ukrainian National holiday updates/ information on local Ukrainian events etc. </p>
            <p>To action this request in the UDP:</p>
            <ol>

            <h3 id="what-mfa" class="y-target">What is Multi Factor Authentication?</h3>
            <p>Multi Factor Authentication (MFA) is a process in which users are prompted for an additional form of identification during the sign-in process. This is usually a code or biometric login through their mobile phone. Using MFA increases the security of using the data platform.</p>
            <p>A second form of identification makes it harder for attackers to obtain or duplicate your login details, so we recommend you use your own mobile phone to authenticate your access to the data platform.</p>
            <p>You can do this in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using the Microsoft Authenticator app</li>
                <li>Requesting a code sent by SMS to your phone</li>
            </ol>
            <h3 id="app" class="y-target">Using the Microsoft Authenticator app</h3>
            <p>When you are accessing the Homes for Ukraine data platform for the first time, you will need to set up the Authenticator App. Once complete, it will remember all of your details and is quick to use each time you use the platform.</p>
            <p>The app plays no other role on your phone than helping you log into the platform when you require access.</p>
            <p>To get started with either authentication method, you will need to access the Data Platform first.</p>
            <div id="dynamics-365-access" class="vspacer"></div>
            <h4>Accessing the Data Platform</h4>

            <p>Once you have successfully set up MFA, you will be taken to the Homes for Ukraine system. Each time you log into the data platform in future, you will be prompted to use your thumbprint or pin code on the app to authenticate your identity.</p>
            <h3 id="sms" class="y-target">Requesting a code sent by SMS to your phone</h3>
            <p>When you are accessing the Homes for Ukraine data platform for the first time, you will also need to set up the authenticator SMS. Once complete, it will remember all of your details and is quick to use each time you use the platform.</p>
