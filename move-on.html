                <h2 id="the-move-on-process" class="y-target">The Move on Process</h2>
                <p>Prior to July 2023, the way in which we handled the move-on process was using a spreadsheet solution sitting in an Objective Connect environment to enable sharing. </p>
                <p>Move-on functionality was previously not developed in UDP as at the time there was insufficient time to stand-up a solution and the UDP information governance restrictions hindered our ability to make the move-on data available across all local authorities.</p>
                <p>The move-on process has become the key focus of the Ukraine programme. In closing Initial Accommodation (IA) and Welcome Centres (WC) the overarching aim is to move people from WC/IA accommodation to longer term accommodation including hosted accommodation. We are also looking to place new applicant arrivals directly into hosted accommodation to reduce use of initial accommodation.</p>
                <p>There is now a more definitive need to incorporate the move on process into the UDP and by doing so will reduce data duplication, provide a more consistent approach to managing move-on, make processes easier and will provide us with a complete single source of the truth.</p>
                <p>The new process, as such, will remain quite like the current process: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>EOI offers will need to be triaged by the local authority. </li>
                    <li>All standard housing and DBS checks will need to be completed.</li>
                    <li>Once checks have successfully been completed the property will be made available to all LA’s when searching.</li>
                    <li>LA’s will be able to locate properties based on the criteria set out in the housing need for each household.</li>
                    <li>A property can be reserved by any LA and once reserved, becomes unavailable to others that are using the move on search function. </li>
                    <li>Once matching has been completed a placement tracking will be auto created.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>New processes that will be introduced following the move into the UDP (on 5th July 2023) will be as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>There will be no requirement to upload the EOI manually into the UDP and you will not be required to enter data previously received via Objective Connect (this will be made Read Only) .  All EOI’s that come through the Welsh Government Homes for Ukraine smart survey will be automatically uploaded via a data load.</li>
                    <li>The LA will be responsible for inputting information into a new ‘offered property’ tab which will help aid the search functionality. </li>
                    <li>The new search functionality will ensure that only one property can be reserved at a time.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Please Note:</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>EOI’s that are matched outside of the smart survey, usually as a result of self-matching will still have to be manually uploaded to the platform.</li>
                    <li>The move on process will also amalgamate <b>all</b> available hosts – not just EOI’s.  This means that when a household leaves their hosted accommodation and the host is still willing to host another family, the LA can recycle this record to be used within the reservation process on the move on search tab. </li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2 id="eoi-data-feed" class="y-target">EOIs and the Data Feed </h2>
                <p>All data we receive from the EOI smart survey will automatically be uploaded into the UDP.  The data will be split into two parts and will feed into the relevant sections.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>EOI data that relates to the host / host address</b> will be uploaded into the system as a sponsor record for that host address.  The sponsor will be created automatically based on the information generated from the smart survey and will sit with the local authority where the host address is located. </li>
                    <li><b>EOI data that relates to the offer of the property</b> will be separated and linked into the fields on the offered property tab within the host address section.</li>
                    <p>It will be the Local Authority’s responsibility to contact the proposed host to clarify the data and capture any missing information.</p>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <div class="article-divider"></div>
            <section>
                <h2 id="contact-centre" class="y-target">LA / Contact Centre Responsibilities for the Move On Process</h2>
                <p>Both the contact centre and each respective LA will have responsibilities within the UDP to ensure that the move on process runs smoothly.</p>
                <h4>Contact Centre Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>The Contact Centre’s responsibility within the move on process is to ensure that direct allocations for Super Sponsor applicants runs smoothly.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The overarching concept of direct allocation to hosts includes allocating arrivals through the Welsh Government Super Sponsor Scheme to hosts prior to their arrival in Wales.  People will travel directly to hosts on arrival in the UK rather than placed in initial accommodation. Directly allocating people reduces the demand on initial accommodation and the need for local authorities to move people on from initial accommodation.  </li>
                    <li>The Contact Centre will identify available host offers via the move on search.  They will then liaise with local authorities to coordinate the direct allocations and matching people to suitable hosts. People will not be directly allocated to a host by the Contact Centre without the agreement of the receiving local authority.  The intention is to directly allocate all new arrivals to hosts where suitable host offers are identified.  People will be offered initial accommodation in the form of a Welcome Centre or holiday park where a suitable host is not available.    </li>
                    <li>The Contact Centre will liaise between hosts and guests regarding arrival and travel to Wales.  The contact centre will also manage the reservation process via the UDP to ensure that household records are linked and moved to the owning Local Authority of the new host / host address once the reservation process has been completed. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Local Authority Responsibilities</h4>
                <p>Each local authority will need to ensure that they have completed the following.</p>
                <p>For Households/Applicants:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Every Household within their LA has a completed Housing Need Tab.</li>
                    <li>When a person joins or leaves the household the Housing Need Tab is updated to reflect the new household set up.</li>
                    <li>The household timeline is updated with any important (but non sensitive) notes regarding the household. </li>
                    <li>When actioning the move on search the LA must do this from the household tab and should consider the household needs when filtering their search. </li>
                    <li>When a property has been reserved the LA must liaise with the host address Local Authority (if this is different to their own)</li>
                    <li>When a property has been reserved, process the reservation through the stages, via the reservation status dropdowns, until the match is complete – regardless of whether the property is in your LA or not.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For sponsors/hosts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>For every Sponsor or host (EOI), all sponsor and household checks must be completed and toggled before the property is made available in the move on search.</li>
                    <li>Keep track of each reserved property within your LA (by means a of a view)</li>
                    <li>Keep track of any hosts and host addresses that become available after their applicants have vacated to conduct a triage call for potential further hosting responsibilities (accessed by means of a view)</li>
                    <li>Liaise with LAs who reserve one of your properties for their household – to arrange meetings and travel. </li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <p>The housing need section is now a tab within the household page. You will no longer access the housing need via the ‘Linked housing need’ field on the household page, this has been removed.  Although the record may look the same, we have developed and added a few fields that will contribute to assisting the matching process. </p>

                </ul>
                <p>Every Household ID, where the household is seeking new accommodation, should have a completed housing need tab which helps Local Authority colleagues when matching individuals to suitable accommodation, whether that be for individuals needing to be re-housed via the super sponsor scheme or for individuals who have arrived on the individual sponsor scheme.</p>

                <p>A host address is the address of the accommodation being offered to house applicants travelling to Wales. Occasionally, a host may have multiple addresses and may wish to offer a few of these to host within. The host may or may not live at these addresses.</p>
                <p>To add a host address you need to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Click on the Sponsor section in left hand navigation and find the sponsor/host record required.</li>
                    <li>Open the Sponsor/host record.</li>
                    <li>Click on the Host Addresses Tab and click on New Host Address</li>

                    <li>Complete the form, considering the following:
                        <ul><li>Address fields are for the accommodation that is being offered which may not necessarily be the address at which the host lives.</li>
                        <li>Staying with Sponsor field indicates whether the property is the main residence of the sponsor and their family e.g. someone would be allocated a room in the sponsors/host house rather than accommodation separately owned by the sponsor/host.</li></ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Save the record.</li>
                    <li>You now need to assign the host address records to ensure everyone in your local authority group can access the records - Select the address and click Assign Host Address.</li>
                    <li>Assign to User or Team and then hit enter to browse your local authority. </li>

                </ol>
                <p>To check, this has happened correctly, you can check the host address to ensure the host local authority has changed as well as the ‘owner’ in the top right corner of the record. This may take a little while to filter through so refresh after 20 to 30 seconds.</p>
                <p>Creating a new host address will also create a new offered property tab.  These two will be linked via the Host Address reference.</p>

If they do, all previous checks should be confirmed to still be valid before making changing the offered property status to available.</p>
                <p><b>Please note: </b>If the host no longer wishes to house any new applicants, then their records need to be set to withdrawn and this will automatically set the offered property tab to removed. </p>

                <p>The view can show records from all local authorities across Wales in one table but also enables users to filter a few LA’s at one time or narrow the search down to one LA at a time.  This will ensure that LA’s can tailor their initial findings based on area, which can either be across the whole of Wales or for a particular LA and its surrounding areas if required.</p>
                <p><b>To search by the whole of Wales:</b></p>
                <p>Select the Wales Wide drop down in the Available Properties table.  This will show all available properties across every local authority within Wales.  This view can be filtered to tailor the search to the household needs, including filtering to specific locations. </p>

                <p>There may be occasions where a match is deemed unsuccessful.  This may be due to the host or household changing their mind, it may be due to unsuitable accommodation/ location, or it may simply be that the property was reserved in error.</p>
                <p>When this happens, you should:</p>
                <ol><li>Make a note on the timeline explaining the reason for the match being unsuccessful (if necessary and remember to not include any sensitive information).</li>
                <li>Ensure both parties are aware that the reservation will be deleted.</li>
                <li>Set the reservation status to RS08 – Match Unsuccessful. </li></ol>
            
            <p>If RS08 – Match Unsuccessful is selected, then a sub status reason will appear.  This will enable you to specify the reason for the unsuccessful match.  This will ensure that no unnecessary information is inputted into the system and a generalised status reason is displayed.  The status reason does not include detailed information of why the match was unsuccessful, it is for overview purposes only.</p>
            <p>One of the following status reasons should be selected depending on the individual circumstances: </p>
            <table><tr><th>RS08 – Match Unsuccessful Status Reason </th>
            <th>When should this be used?</th></tr>
            <tr><td>Household rejected host </td>
            <td>When the household has decided that the host / hosted property or location is not suitable for them. This should also be selected if a host has failed further DBS checks.</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Host rejected Household </td>
            <td>When the host has decided that the household is not suitable for them to host</td></tr>
            <tr><td>Both parties in disagreement </td>
            <td>When both the host and household agree that the hosting isn’t suitable for either party.  </td></tr>
            <tr><td>Property reserved in error </td>
            <td>When a property has been reserved incorrectly and no action has been taken </td></tr>

        <h3 id="pt-active-reservation" class="y-target">Creating PT’s when there is an active reservation. </h3>
        <p>There may be occasions where a reservation is in progress and a family need to move temporarily to emergency accommodation until the new reservation is complete.</p>
        <p>The system will allow a PT to be created whilst the reservation is in place providing the person is staying within the same LA.  Once the reservation is completed the new PT will close the previous and pull in the new reservation and host details.</p>
        <h4>If a PT is created with the local authority as outside of Wales: (outside of UK); (England) (Scotland):</h4>
        <p>This may be due to the individuals repatriating or relocating.  The system will prevent the PT from being created until the reservation has been closed.  The below error message will appear: </p>
        <img src="assets/images/moveon/error.png" alt="Screenshot of error message explaining that You need first to close the reservation before you can create move on placement tracking outside Wales">
        <p>The reason this is blocked is to stop open reservations from being left in the system.  If a reservation has fallen through because the household has decided to leave Wales this should be set to RS08 – match unsuccessful and the status reason, be set to ‘property reserved in error’ before a PT repatriation or move on (with England or Scotland as the LA) PT is created on the household.</p>
        <h3 id="other-placement" class="y-target">Other Placement Types</h3>
        <h4>If Sponsor/Host PT is selected</h4>
        <p>If a sponsor/host Placement type is selected whilst there is an active reservation, the system will prevent the PT from being created: </p>
        <img src="assets/images/moveon/warning.png" alt="Screenshot of warning message stating that In order to create placement tracking from the type sponsor/host please create a reservation">
        <p>This is because the reservation process should be followed to create a sponsor/host PT. </p>
        <p><b>Please note:</b></p>
        <p>If there is a host already attached to the household (from a previous/ current placement) then until the reservation is set to 'Matched' - RS02 – RS06, a host/ sponsor placement tracking will still be able to be created but will link to the current host linked to the household page.  Once the status is reflected to show the host / household as matched, the above error will appear preventing a PT from being created until the reservation process has been successfully completed.</p>
        <h4>If there is no active reservation</h4>
        <p>If the reservation process hasn’t been started but there is a host attached to the household (from previous data load) and no PT has yet been created, the system will allow this to be created to reflect the current hosted placement.  </p>
        <p>When the time comes for the host to be changed, the reservation process should be followed. </p>
        <h4>If any other PT is selected</h4>
        <p>If any of the below PTs are created whilst a reservation is in place, the system will allow the PT to be created provided that the local authority is within Wales:</p>
        <ul><li>Hospital</li>
        <li>Move on accomodation</li>
        <li>Temporary accomodation</li>
        <li>Welcome Centre</li>
        <li>Temporarily Left</li></ul>
        <p>You should only need to create these placement tracking’s in emergency situations where someone needs to be relocated prior to the reservation process being completed.  </p>
        <p>If you are creating a placement tracking for a more permanent move that is not a host/sponsor placement created via the reservation process, you should close the active reservation <b>before</b>creating the PT. </p>
        <h3 id="view-all-reserved-la" class="y-target">To view all reserved hosts and properties that reside within your LA </h3>
        <p>Because the reserving LA has access to the reservation only, as the receiving LA you will have access to a system view that will ensure that you have sight of all reserved properties situated within your LA.</p>
        <p>To access the view:</p>
        <ol><li>Go to the offered properties tab (accessing via the left-hand Navigation)</li>
        <li>Select the view ‘My Offered Properties with an Active Reservation’ view </li></ol>
        <p>This will enable you to track the offered properties that have been reserved and what their current offered property statuses are. </p>
        <h3 id="changes-current-process" class="y-target">Changes to the current process for linking a household record with a sponsor/host</h3>
        <p>Previously you were required to add a host to the household page and then create a placement tracking. </p>
        <p>To make the connection between host and household you now need to follow and complete the reservation process via the move on search in the household tab.  </p>
        <p>The host / host address fields on the household are now locked fields and the information will filter through from the completion of the reservation process: </p>
        <img src="assets/images/moveon/locked-fields.png" alt="Screenshot of Host and Host address showing as locked">
        <h4>Replacing an existing host / sponsor</h4>
        <p>You will no longer have access to replace a host on the household page.  The host / host address fields will be locked, and the reservation process needs to be followed to link a suitable host with a household. </p>
        <p>Completing the reservation process automatically creates a new link between the new host and household alongside automatically creating the placement tracking.  If there was a previous host linked to the household this process will replace that host and close all PTs associated with the previous hosting to free them up to potentially be available again. </p>
        <h4>Removing a host / sponsor </h4>
        <p>To remove a host/sponsor from a household who have moved out of hosted accommodation you will need to follow the process to create a placement tracking for anything other than host/sponsor.  </p>
        <p>When a new placement tracking record is created for any placement type other than ‘sponsor/host’ – the host details will automatically be removed from the Household page. The locked host field will remain locked prior to ending the current placement tracking and the creation of the new placement tracking will end the current sponsor/host placement tracking and remove that link to the host on the household. </p>
        <h4>For No Shows </h4>
        <p>When the IS or SS journey status is set to <b>>No Show (IS21- No Show – Known; IS22 No Show – Unknown; SS05D – No Show – Known; SS05E – No Show – Unknown)</b> for all applicants within the household, any details in the locked host/host address fields on the household will automatically remove.</p>
        <p>If one or more household members are not set to no show, the details will remain locked on the household page until all are changed to the no show status.  It’s important to split the households if some applicants intend to travel and others don’t. </p>

            <h2 id="match-process" class="y-target">Match Process</h2>
                <p>Once the final steps for the reservation process have been completed you will need to:</p>
                <ul><li>Ensure all necessary timeline notes have been created.</li>
                <li>Set the reservation status to RS07- Move on match complete.</li>

            <p>Once the match process is completed successfully a placement tracking will be created whether this is within the same current LA or whether the new hosted arrangement is in a different LA.</p>
            <p>The completed match process (setting the status to RS07- Move on match complete with the start date) will link the host and household together on the host section of the household tab.  It will create a placement tracking on the household, applicant and sponsor records and will move the household into the new LA (if the household is moving from one LA to another).  To confirm this has processed correctly you can go back into the household record and into placement tracking’s and view the new placement tracking records.  If the household is moving to a new LA you will lose sight of the household record completely once you have entered the start date for the reservation. </p>
            <h4>Matching within the same LA</h4>
            <p>If the household and host both reside in your local authority, then the match process will mirror the reservation process: </p>
            <ol><li>Find a suitable host by using the move on search.</li>
            <li>Reserve the host.</li>
            <li>Follow and complete the reservation process.</li>
            <li>Ensure all necessary timeline notes have been created.</li>
            <li>Set the reservation status to RS07- Move on match complete.</li>
            <li>Set the start date as the first day of the new placement.</li>
        <li>Click Save or Save & Close.</li></ol>
        <p>Once the match process is completed successfully a placement tracking for ‘Sponsor/host’ will be created and will create the link between the host and household.  The new host details replace any existing host details on the household and applicant records and the creation of the new placement tracking will close any previous placement tracking’s associated with these records. </p>
        <p>If you are creating a placement tracking for any other option other than ‘sponsor/host’ for example ‘move on accommodation’ this will not pull through the host details into the placement tracking.  It is important that you consider the below placement reasons and when to use them within a placement tracking record: </p>
