            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Wales, Nation of Sanctuary: Ukraine Data Platform (UDP) was launched in June 2022. This system is aimed at helping our joint response to Ukrainian’s seeking sanctuary in Wales – by ensuring security of individuals and their families by recording their individual journey from the point they receive their letter to travel through to being safely settled in their permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p>The system is hosted by Digital Health and Care Wales (DHCW). DHCW provide the service desk support for the system, but further support is provided by Welsh Government, Microsoft and DHCW Infrastructure team.</p>
            <p>This page sets out the service model to be adopted by all local authorities and health boards when seeking assistance on the system to ensure DHCW can provide a timely response to queries.</p>
            <p>The sort of incident scenarios we anticipate can be categorised into the following:</p>
