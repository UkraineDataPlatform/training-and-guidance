                    <p>To Search for a record in the system there are two ways you can do this. </p>
                    <p>So, you can either go to the top search box in the right-hand side here, which will search the section of the system that you're currently in. </p>
                    <p>So, as you can see here, I'm in the applicant section. </p>
                    <p>So, if I type in Jones and click enter it will return any record with the name Jones linked to it. </p>
                    <p>So, as you can see here these are all the applicants with the surname Jones. </p>
                    <p>To do a more wider search of the system you can use the search box at the top of the page. </p>
                    <p>So again, typing in Jones at the top here, if you just click enter, it will show you all records within the system that have the surname Jones. </p>
                    <p>So, it's split into different sections. As you can see you've got all sponsors here, all applicants or all applications. </p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>As individuals on the Super Sponsor and Individual Sponsorship schemes move through our systems, it'll be necessary to change their journey status codes to reflect their progress.</p>
                    <p>So we can change that for both individual records, and we can also do that through the household ID to edit the records at the same time of all of the members of the household.</p>
                    <p>So to edit one person's record, so in this case Carol's record, we come to the SS journey status and we click the dropdown and once you're ready to change their status, you simply click the next status on the list and save.</p>
                    <p>And that has now applied that status change to Carol's record.</p>
                    <p>Now if we click on the household ID, you can see that we have another member of the household and this person is also ready to move on and to change their journey status.</p>
                    <p>So in fact, if we wanted to change the records of everyone in the household group, we come to the table at the bottom of the screen and we click Select All.</p>
                    <p>And then where we have the Edit button, this enables us to edit the two records at the same time. So we go to the SS journey status, the same dropdown that we had for the individual screen, and we click SSO8, Ready for Move On, and we click Save.</p>
                    <p>And those two records have now been saved and that ensures that the whole household now all have the same status code and are ready for move on.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Some individuals coming through our schemes may have complex cases,and what we mean by complex cases is that they may have additional health or well-being concerns or safeguarding concerns which local authorities need to be aware of due to the nature of the system not being designed to handle sensitive information.</p>
                    <p>It's important to have a means of flagging complex cases on this system and ensuring that anyone handling that case can refer to local information and local files for further details on the complexity and the nature of those cases</p>
                    <p>So to add a complex case note, we come to an individual's record. So we'll use Rachel in this case.</p>
                    <p>On Rachel's record, we're going to first add a 'Yes' at the top here to indicate that shehas complex case and we're going to also enter a note to say. Complex Case and with that we can say,"please speak to N Jones for further information".</p>
                    <p>And that just means that we can flag who the person is that has the information or that is the best person to speak to for further details on this case.</p>
                    <p>So when we save,that note is added under complex case and you can see that the flag here is yes. If we then come out of the record, when you go back into Rachel's record in future, if you double click, you're instantly shown that there is a complex case flag on this system.</p>
                    <p>So that means that nobody can access this record without being aware that this is a complex case and that they need to refer to local case notes for further information to provide the right support available.</p>

                </div>

                </div> 
                <div class="transcript">
                    <p>The platform has been developed to enable you to capture where checks and appointments have been undertaken on the system and also to add any case notes and activities which identify actions that have taken place to support that person.</p>
                    <p>If we have a look on Joanna's record here, you can see that we have a box on the right-hand side for individual sponsor applicant checks and these are checks that are specific to people who are on the individual sponsorship route.</p>
                    <p>So when you as a local authority have undertaken a particular action, you can change this toggle box here in order to make sure that you capture that the action has taken place.  So in this case, we could say that a welfare visit has been completed and then interim payment of £200 has been made.</p>
                    <p>We can change those toggles to yes and click save and that ensures that that record has been updated.  We can also do this for multiple individuals as well.  So if we were to search in the system for a family group and we can look at this particular household.</p>
                    <p>So the lead contact, the lead applicant is Stephen and we can see that we have some checks here that are relative to the Super Sponsor Scheme. You can undertake these checks individually for each person within the household or you can actually update the checks at the same time for both members of the household.</p>
                    <p>As you can see we have both Stephen and Alexandra.  To update sponsor super applicants or individual sponsor applicant checks at the same time, whichever scheme they're on, a tab is available here which enables you to update their actions at the same time.</p>
                    <p>So if we wanted to say that both Alexandra and Stephen have had their medical screening. We can use this tab and this box in order to quickly update their records and we can either use the save button at the top here or the tiny little disc save button on the right-hand side here. And that has updated their records so that if we went back to look at their individual records you would now be able to see on Stephen's individual record that that welcome centre medical screening button has changed to a yes.</p>
                    <p>And if we were to go and look at his relative, Alexandra's record here, which we can use this navigate button to do, we can also see that she has had this button changed to a yes,  so that's a means of changing the checks for multiple members of a household at the same time.</p>
                    <p>One other check that it's important to show you is around sponsors.  For example, if we have a sponsor who has a household, so who has other members of their household that need to complete a DBS check, such as these sponsor checks over here, we would only change these toggles when we’re satisfied that ALL members of the household that require a DBS check and have them completed.   So not just the sponsor but any members of the household.</p>
                    <p>And once you're satisfied that those checks have been completed for all sponsor household members that need them, then you can change that tab. And you can save that as well and that's a record that you've completed that note. </p>
                    <p>All the while we've got case notes and activities here, and you can simply add a note here to say checks have been undertaken.  And you can add further notes in to say that the DBS check was done for all relevant members of the family.</p>
                    <p>By adding notes into this section, it ensures that the next person in your team that comes along can see the activities that have taken place in relation to those checks, or indeed to anything else that you feel is important to add onto a person's record.</p>
                    <p>There are many different notes that you may wish to capture, particularly where, for example, you may have a person who has a complex case.  A complex case is, as referred to in the other video, where somebody might have a particular health or medical requirement or a sensitive case that that we require some sensitive handling and so those can also be added in the case notes here and press save.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>A linked housing need is a section of the system that shows any needs that the person requires in order to move here to Wales. </p>
                    <p>So, this could be anything in terms of accessible property, if they're bringing pets, how many bedrooms they need. </p>
                    <p>So, it depends on the household setup in terms of number of bedrooms and also on the different individual members of the family whether they need any additional requirements adapted within the property. So, to create a linked housing need you need to go into the household section. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm just going to go into this one here Conner Hall, into the family ID, the household section and as the household section and as you can see here we've got the name of the lead applicant it's a single person household and the host is attached to the household here. </p>
                    <p>But the linked housing need is currently blank. </p>
                    <p>So, what we would need to do before the person is housed with their host is just create a linked housing need so that the host is aware of all the adaptations or needs of the individual are before they move into the property. </p>
                    <p>So, if it's a multiple person household, then there may be different requirements for different individuals, but you can record all of that on the one linked housing need. </p>
                    <p>So, to do that, if you just click the left button on your mouse on the linked housing need and you'll see any recent housing needs that you've created. </p>
                    <p>But these could be for other households.  So, what you want to do is create a new one. </p>
                    <p>If there's never been a housing need created, you need to go in and create a new one. </p>
                    <p>So, if you click new housing need and you'll see you've got a blank page here for you to start filling in all the information about the individual. </p>
                    <p>So, first of all we need to just link the applicant. </p>
                    <p>So, if you click the left hand button again, you'll see any recent applicants that you have, worked on, all cases you've worked on. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to type in Connor and then select and the lead applicant in this household. </p>
                    <p>The only applicant in this household at this point. </p>
                    <p>And then I'm just going to first of all fill in the two sections with asterisks and that is so that these are mandatory fields so we can't move forward without them. </p>
                    <p>So, the housing need type will either be single, couple or family. </p>
                    <p>So, in this instance it's a single household. </p>
                    <p>If it was a couple of family then you would select that and then we're just going to move through to the requirements. </p>
                    <p>So, there are a few other sections you can fill out if whatever you feel is relevant. But the main requirements is the biggest part of this form, it's what we need to ensure is met for the person to move into their hosted accommodation. So we know that it's a single person household, so we've got one confirmed family member and one adult, no children. </p>
                    <p>And Connor is 25, he is male, so you just pop an M in for male and he only requires one bedroom with one bed. If Connor was in a family of say three people, you would just change some of this around. So you would put three here, the ages you would put 25 24 and say 12 and then you would put male, female, male or female and then say there were two bedrooms required, or one bedroom but with three beds because there's three members of the family. </p>
                    <p>So, in this instance, I'm just going to clear these out, just showing you how to use that part.  It's one adult. 25 male, one bedroom, 1 bed. </p>
                    <p>So, then we're going to look at the accessibility needs then. </p>
                    <p>So, does he use a wheelchair? </p>
                    <p>Does he need an adapted property? </p>
                    <p>Does he require any care or additional bathrooms or a private bathroom? </p>
                    <p>Things like that. </p>
                    <p>So, it's important that you capture this information so that we can ensure the right property is provided. </p>
                    <p>So, if Connor was a wheelchair user, you could select yes and pop some information here and maybe you would need the adapted property so that the wheelchair can fit through the door frames and things like that. </p>
                    <p>We'll put that for now and then you could put some notes in the general notes to say why it may be that there is some more accessibility requirements. Because he's a wheelchair user, there will need to be a ramp. Or maybe if he's relying on a walking stick or crutches then he may need a ramp as well because he can't walk upstairs and things like that. </p>
                    <p>So, it's important to record all this information. It's also important to record if any pets are coming with the applicant and to make sure that when the property is suitable for pets and that the host is aware. </p>
                    <p>So, once we filled out all this information, we're going to go up to the top and just click save. Saving the house in need gives the record a reference number so housing need reference number will always begin with HN, have a dash and then a 6 digit number. </p>
                    <p>So, as you can see here we've got HN- 001630. So that is the linked housing need for Connor Hall. </p>
                    <p>So, what you're going to do now is you're happy with everything you're going to save and close. And it will take you back to the household record. </p>
                    <p>So, as we can see, there is still no linked housing need. </p>
                    <p>So, what you need to do is you need to add that in. So, you need to connect the housing need that you've created for Connor into his household record. So, to do that again you just click with the left button of your mouse and it will show you all recent housing needs that you've created. </p>
                    <p>So, as you can see the 1630 in here is that one that you've just created. </p>
                    <p>So, all you do is click and save. And you've now got your housing need linked to the household so that we can ensure that the correct property and the correct host are matched to this applicant. </p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Whenever household moves from one place to another, it's really important that we create a placement tracking to show this.</p>
                    <p>So, the placement tracking will give a timeline of different places that the applicant has been staying, so including start and end dates and therefore we'll have a history of all places they've stayed at during their time in Wales. </p>
                    <p>To create a placement tracking, we're going to use the household page. </p>
                    <p>It's important to start on the household page because creating a placement tracking here mean that a placement tracking will filter into all members of the household applicant pages. </p>
                    <p>So, as you can see here on the household page, we've got a host in situ. </p>
                    <p>When creating a placement tracking if it's for a host or sponsor, so if the person is staying with a host, you need to make sure the host is on the household section first before creating a placement tracking. </p>
                    <p>If there is no host on the placement tracking, you will need to allocate the host by selecting the name and host address in these boxes before creating the placement tracking. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to go into the placement tracking now. So, this tab here at the top and we're going to create a placement tracking for this record. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to go into new placement tracking here and just click it. And here you will see a new placement tracking form. </p>
                    <p>So, you can see the family ID is pulled through. So, we've got a few sections with asterisks that we need to make sure we include. </p>
                    <p>So, it's a host or sponsor drop down, so I'm going to select that from the placement type and as you can see it pulls through the host on the right-hand side. </p>
                    <p>It gives you their address and the local authority. If, for instance, it's not host or sponsor placement and it's a welcome center, then the host wouldn't need to be updated and it wouldn't show. </p>
                    <p>And I'll show you a few types of, placement tracking through this video. </p>
                    <p>So, we're going to put a start date, so we'll just say January the first. </p>
                    <p>We don't need to put an end date or the date it was allocated because we are opening this as an open placement tracking and we also don't need to put a welcome center because we can see it is a host address. </p>
                    <p>So, the local authority is already auto populated because the host is linked to the to the household page. </p>
                    <p>So, all we're going to do now is save this.  If I just go back, you can now see there is a placement tracking with the host Sam Brown for this household. </p>
                    <p>You can go into the applicant pages, and you can see that the placement tracking will pull through there. </p>
                    <p>I'll just go through that now. So, with Leonard Powell, if I go into his applicant page and go to placement tracking, you'll see there is a sponsor host placement with Sam Brown linked. </p>
                    <p>You can also do the same for the other family members. </p>
                    <p>So, if I just go into Graham Henry, go to his placement tracking and again you can see his placement there. If I go into the sponsor, and into the sponsor record. </p>
                    <p>You will also see a placement tracking there for both applicants plus one for the household, so you will always see one for each applicant and then one for the household. </p>
                    <p>OK. </p>
                    <p>So, what I'm going to do now is just pop back to the household page and show you a different scenario. </p>
                    <p>So, if for instance this person then decides that they don't want to live with their sponsor and they're going to go into, they need to go into temporary accommodation until we can find a more suitable host. </p>
                    <p>So, we're just going to use temporary accommodation as the example for this one. </p>
                    <p>We need to make sure we close down the existing placement tracking and open up a new one. </p>
                    <p>So, you don't need to do anything with the host at this point, you just need to go into the placement tracking and we're going to firstly go into this one, the first one created. </p>
                    <p>And we're going to just give it an end date. And we're going to say that on the 31st of January it ended and the move on reason was because, there was a host relationship breakdown so then we're going to end it on the 31st because they no longer want to live with their host, there was a relationship breakdown. </p>
                    <p>So, once I save and close that it will auto populate an end date. </p>
                    <p>You may sometimes not see this straight away. </p>
                    <p>Give it a few seconds or refresh your page and it will show. </p>
                    <p>So again, I can just pop, to Leonard's profile, go to his placement tracking's and as you can see, as I said, it does take a little while, but if you just give it a little refresh, go to placement tracking’s it may take a little bit longer, sometimes it does to feed through to the system but it will show you when I create the new one. </p>
                    <p>So, if I go back to placement tracking, I'm going to create a new placement tracking now on the household page for temporary accommodation. </p>
                    <p>So, if I go into temporary accommodation, no host or sponsor will pull through and the date is going to be from the 31st of January because that is the same date that they left the previous accommodation. </p>
                    <p>And I'm just going to put Wrexham local authority because they're still at this point staying in the same local authority. </p>
                    <p>I just save and close that.  You can now see they've left Sam Brown and they're now in temporary accommodation. </p>
                    <p>You can put things like the address in, so I would expect if they were going into temporary accommodation, for instance, into maybe a hotel or something like that you can put the address so that we've got that information there. </p>
                    <p>And again, hopefully this time with the system refresh we should be able to see, there you go, there's your end date. </p>
                    <p>It does just take a little while to pull through to the applicant pages and you've got your new temporary accommodation there. </p>
                    <p>The scenario I'm going to use next is just the final sort of placement tracking that we would expect to see, is if they were moving from one local authority to another. </p>
                    <p>So, to do that if there is a host on the, if they have come from a hosted address and there's a host on the household page, it doesn't matter. </p>
                    <p>You just leave it where it is because using a move on accommodation will remove that host. </p>
                    <p>So again, back in the household, we always create placement tracking from the household page and it filters down through to the applicant. </p>
                    <p>Go back to placement tracking and again we're going to close this temporary accommodation. </p>
                    <p>So, if we just open this, and then all I'm going to do is just, what I'm going to do is click the end date as let's say they were there for a week, so until the 7th of February and then move on reason for this one is going to be, let's have a look move on, move on to accommodate family reunion. </p>
                    <p>So, they've been in temporary accommodation. </p>
                    <p>Now I'm going to say they're going to another local authority to relocate with family. </p>
                    <p>So, we'll save and close that. </p>
                    <p>And it's closed. </p>
                    <p>So, then we're going to open up a new one and this time we are going to do a move on accommodation. </p>
                    <p>So, we're going to say that they go on the 7th. </p>
                    <p>So, it doesn't matter if the days override because they would be going on that same day and all you need to do is put a start date and then the new local authority. </p>
                    <p>So, if I put Carmarthenshire. </p>
                    <p>So, all we do is select that, save and close. </p>
                    <p>And then you've got a move on accommodation, it'll be down to Carmarthenshire to then pick that up and update their records, their end with the address of the new host. </p>
                    <p>And if I just pop into the applicant page, you can see a timeline here as well and that will show history of different placement tracking’s for the individuals and the household. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="transcript">
                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>There are times when it's necessary to remove an individual from a household group for example because of relationship breakdown or because the group may not all be travelling together at the same time and therefore not all accommodated together.</p>
                    <p>There are three steps in doing this. </p>
                    <p>The first step is to remove the individual from the household group (the household under that household ID).</p>
                    <p>The second is to edit the housing needs, the linked housing needs record for the group that they are leaving,</p>
                    <p>and the third is to create a new linked housing need record for that individual if they're moving to a separate group on their own.</p>
                    <p>So the first step, under the Households menu, is to click on the family Household ID.  And as we can see we have this person here James Stephenson.</p>
                    <p>And for the purposes of this example, we're going to remove him from this group. So we use the action box and we click select and we have the three options there and remove applicant to a new household is our option.</p>
                    <p>It will only allow you to enter the names of people who are already in this group and there we can see James. And we'll say that he is being removed from this group as he's travelling separately. And our start date is today.</p>
                    <p>So after this day he won't be part of this household group, so you can save that. And this now means that he is no longer a member of this group. And so because he's no longer in the group, the next thing we need to do is to go and edit the linked housing need record.</p>
                    <p>So we click on the link. And as you can see, if we scroll down that there are requirements which are based upon James being a part of that group.</p>
                    <p>So we're going to edit this so that it's now just the three members of the group. So three confirmed family members, 3 adults, no children, and we're just going to take these details out which were relevant to James being a part of the group.</p>
                    <p>The number of bedrooms and beds are the same because he would have been sharing with the lead applicant in this scenario and so now that we've made those changes we can save and that means that James's housing requirements are no longer reflected under the household ID that he's been removed from.</p>
                    <p>If we go to the Applicants table, we can search for James. And here we can find him. So if we double click, this is James's single profile, and as you can see, his household ID is now WG code, and that means that he's been separated out from a previous household and that's why he has a WG code.</p>
                    <p>So if we click on that link this enables us then to create a new linked housing need for James. So if we click in the box here, we can come to the line that says new housing need and we can add that in.</p>
                    <p>So it's James that we're looking for and that automatically populates across to his household ID reference. And we can see that he's a single person. He's on the Super sponsor scheme. </p>
                    <p>We'll say that there's one person in the family, one adult, he's 40 and that he's male. One bedroom required and one bed. And he doesn't require any accessible property. He doesn't have any pets, and there are no other details that we need to capture within this housing needs section.</p>
                    <p>What you may wish to do here is to make a note of this household ID number. Because we have one final step which is to make sure that this housing record is attached to James's profile.</p>
                    <p>So we save this. And we go back to James. You can either use the back button, or you can simply click on James's name and this will take you back here. And if we click on his household ID code again, you can see that there's nothing in the link housing need here.</p>
                    <p>So if you click it will actually produce the number of the most recent one that we were working on. So you can add that, save and that will ensure that it's the correct details saved.</p>
                    <p>There we go. And so that's how you save that information.</p>

                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>There may be circumstances when it's necessary to either add or remove a person to a household or to change the lead applicant of the group. This video explains that process.</p>
                    <p>It's vital that when adding or editing household groups, any housing requirements associated with those groups are also amended to reflect the change and if you change the lead applicant, you must reset the relationships between the applicants in the group.</p>
                    <p>So, this video is going to look at how you add an applicant to an existing household group.</p>
                    <p>So, the first thing we're going to do is go to our existing household group that we want to add an applicant into. So, if we click on the household ID, this will bring up our group. As you can see, we currently have three members of the group, and there are a group of friends who are travelling together.</p>
                    <p>What we're going to do is, again, use the action box that we've used previously to add an applicant, and we're going to search here for the name of the applicant that we're bringing into the family group.</p>
                    <p>So, in this case it's James Stephenson. And he's being added to the group. And he's being added because he has met a member of the existing group and he is now their partner and so they wish to travel together and to be accommodated together. So, we're going to save that change.</p>
                    <p>And as you can now see, we have a new person added to our household group. And so, it's necessary here to first make sure that we change the relationship so we can see that there's no relationship set yet for James. So, we can add that to, say, spouse or partner, and then we can save that change.</p>
                    <p>And the next thing we need to do, of course, is to edit our linked housing need record so that the needs of James are also reflected within that group. So, we're going to go to the linked housing need back at the top of the record, and we're going to click where there's a link in the name of the file. And this brings up the housing need record.</p>
                    <p>So, when we scroll down to the bottom of the page here, we can see the main requirements. We're now going to edit this so that it's four members of the group. It's 4 adults and we're going to edit this to show that we have an additional person who is 40 and male who has joined the group. And because he is a partner and is intending to share a room with Ashley, the lead applicant, there's no change to the number of bedrooms or beds required and he has no other requirements in terms of pets or any primary care or accessibility needs, so we can now save this record.</p>
                    <p>And this ensures that we have James's needs within the record for this household. And that ensures that the family group is up to date and that everybody is accounted for when we're looking to accommodate them later.</p>

                    <p>And if you're changing a lead applicant, you must reset the relationships between the applicants in the group.</p>
                    <p>So to change a lead applicant we will use the households menu and if we select the household ID here, this will show all of the members of that household listed down here.</p>
                    <p>So if we want to change the lead applicant at the moment, we can see that it's Ashley Baker here because we have the yes. And it's also indicated in this field here that Ashley Baker is the lead applicant.</p>
                    <p>So to make any changes to a household group, we use this action box here. When you click select, you select the activity that you want to do. So select lead applicant, set lead applicant. And what we're going to do is pick one of the other people who are featured in the list. So we're going to change Laura Hill to become the lead applicant.</p>
                    <p>So we can start typing Nora's name here. And you can see that she's there and we can make a comment to say that we've changed Laura to lead applicant. And the date can be today. Now we can save here at the top. </p>
                    <p>And then when that’s saved, you'll be able to see that the lead applicant has now changed. And if we look down here, we can see that the relationships between the members of the group have also changed. </p>
                    <p>So now that Laura is the lead applicant, we don't need to set a relationship for her because she doesn't have a relationship to herself. But what we can do is edit Ashley and Katie's statuses so they are a group of friends travelling together. So we can change to friend here we can use either the Save button here or we can use the save button at the top.</p>
                    <p>And again, for Katie will also change that to friend, and we can save that to make sure that we've accounted for all of the differences involved in changing the lead applicant, and we can save and close.</p>
                    <p>And that has now changed, and you can see in the table here that Laura Hill is now the lead applicant of this household group.</p>

                    <iframe class="video-frame" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ASd6wxkUxY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                <div class="transcript">
                    <h4>Video transcript</h4>
                    <p>Within the data platform, it's possible to analyse and interrogate the data that you have using the report columns and filters. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to show you in this video how you can use some of these functions within the views to narrow down the data that you hold. </p>
                    <p>As you can see here, I'm in the all applicants view, so the example I'm going to use is that you want to be able to identify how many under 18 individuals you have within your data. </p>
                    <p>So, the first way we're going to do this is to click the edit filter button and when we click this button, we see the add button here. </p>
                    <p>So, we're going to select add and then add a row and it will ask you to select the field that you want to run the data from. </p>
                    <p>So, as you can see here, if I click the down arrow button there are lots of fields that you can search on. </p>
                    <p>For this example, I want to look at anyone under 18, so I'm going to search via the date of birth.  And then the next box then will ask several different options for you to choose. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to choose on or after and then put the date as today's date from 2005.  This will show me all individuals under 18 in the system. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to click apply, it will run the data and then you'll see, that your data will narrow down to eighteen’s within the system. </p>
                    <p>So, if I just scroll across, as you can see there are many different columns. </p>
                    <p>Here you can see that all the date of birth's here are after 2005. </p>
                    <p>You can actually then narrow this data down further so you can filter it. If you click on the date of birth box here, you can sort older to newer so you can see the oldest to newest individuals within the system. </p>
                    <p>You can also filter by their name, so you could sort A-Z for instance. And then there are all sorts of different ways you can actually filter the columns. </p>
                    <p>So, if you wanted to see if they were lead applicants, so you could filter this by clicking filter by, and then if you want to see if they were, it's just equals select the yes, click apply and you will see anyone who is a lead applicant within this data set. </p>
                    <p>So, there are 65 people under 18 who are lead applicants. If you wanted to then clear that out, you can clear that filter if it wasn't something that you just wanted to have a quick look at but not keep. </p>
                    <p>You can also edit the columns, so if you if you look in here and you can see route and individual journey status, you don't want those because you're only looking at super sponsor journey status. </p>
                    <p>You can go to the edit columns function here and as you can see there are many options, and this is every row that is showing on that view at the moment. </p>
                    <p>So, like I said, if you didn't want route, you can click here, if you just click the three dots to the right-hand side, you can remove it. </p>
                    <p>You can also move it up and down if you wanted this route, if you wanted to keep this route section and move it closer to the left-hand side of the view. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to remove the route for this view and I'm going to remove the IS journey status, we only want to look at super sponsor Journey status. </p>
                    <p>So of course, there are other things you can do. So, say for instance, you wanted their name to be the first thing you see. </p>
                    <p>You can either click the three buttons here and move it up, or you can just hold it and drag it to the top. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to just drag the first and last name and the date of birth. And then followed by the unique application number there. </p>
                    <p>So, once you click apply you will then see your view looks a little bit different, it's moved around. </p>
                    <p>If I then think actually I want to see something else. You can add columns as well in the edit columns filter. </p>
                    <p>So, I want to see their age. So, I want to be able to see the number of age on the view so you can click add column and you'll see there are several columns you can add here. </p>
                    <p>You can't just search, if I type in age you will see age comes up here. You can also look on related and it will tell you, it will filter through other parts of the system that you can pull in. </p>
                    <p>For this one I'm looking at the applicant's age, so once I've clicked it, it's gone from this view. If I click close it will be at the bottom of my columns here, so all I do is just move it up. And you just need to keep scrolling until you place it where you want in the view. </p>
                    <p>So, I'm going to put it next to the date of birth, between the date of birth and unique application number. </p>
                    <p>So, for my view then I can see first name, last name, date of birth, age and then the unique application number and everything else follows afterwards. </p>
                    <p>If you just wanted that you can go in and remove all of these options, but it's entirely up to you how you want to view the data in the system. </p>
                    <p>Then you're going to click apply, give it a moment and there you go. You can see the name, date of birth, age and then the unique application number and so on and so forth.
                    <p>It goes through all the data that you've got in that view. As you can see, there is a asterisks next to the all applicants view. This is because I've edited this to how I want the view to look. </p>
                    <p>If I come out of the view, all my changes will disappear. So, it's really important that you save the view before you come out of the view. So, to do that you just click the downward arrow button here and you'll see any views that are on the system and then you can save as a new view. </p>
                    <p>So, if I just click on that, you can then change it to all applicants and name it. I'm going to name it under 18. You'll need to name it something other than all applicants because that is the default view and then you can put description if you want to. I'm going to leave that blank for now and you just save. </p>
                    <p>So now if I pull the drop down for the views, you can see there is a view for all applicants under 18 with a little person symbol next to it. </p>
                    <p>This is a view that you have created. So as you can see I've got two here, one for training, one for all applicants under 18. </p>
                    <p>Anytime you create a view you will see that, so anything without the little person symbol next to are the default view, so they are the system views. </p>
                    <p>If for instance, I've saved it and then I realize I want to remove a column so I can then edit columns again, and I want to take the place of birth out so I remove that, click apply and I also want to filter it smaller to larger, so smaller to larger on age so you can see that it goes in order there. If I also wanted to filter by everyone Z to A on their surname, so I want to do anyone Z to A on their surname or like I said you can filter it's smaller to larger. </p>
                    <p>If you filter one it will take the filter off the other one. Once I've done that, I can see there's a star again. So that means that if I come out of this it will not save. </p>
                    <p>So, what you need to do is just go back in and save changes to current view. </p>
                    <p>Once you've done that, you'll get a notification to say they've been saved and then your view is there. So you'll always be able to view it and you can always manipulate that if you need to at any time to change the views. </p>

            <h2>De Duplication of Sponsor Records</h2>      
            <p>This is a standalone update to the system.  Once the de-duplication process has been completed, there shouldn’t be a need to use the process again.  All new data feeds will automatically de-duplicate the data.</p>  
            <p>A step-by-step video guide is available here: <a href="#deduplicationvid">De-duplication of Sponsor Records and further system updates | Ukraine Data Platform</a></p>  
                <h3>Relationships of host/sponsors to applicants</h3>
                <p>The relationship for hosts/sponsors to applicants has been updated in the system with a new approach that there will be 1 relationship for the host and 1 relationship for the sponsor.  Although, with most cases these will be the same individuals, the ‘sponsor’ will be linked to the application section only and locked, where as the host will be interchangeable should it need to be deleted / updated / replaced. </p>
                <p>You can view the locked 'sponsor' section by:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Accessing the application page </li>
                    <li>Selecting the general tab </li>
                    <li>The sponsor will show on the middle of the page with a padlock next to the sponsor and host address fields </li>
                    <li>This cannot be changed / updated or removed and will remain the sponsor on the application regardless of if there is a change in host </li>
                    <img src="assets/images/locked-sponsor23.png" alt="Locked sponsor section highlighted in application page">
                </ol>
                <h4>What is the difference between a Sponsor and a Host?</h4>
                <p><b>Sponsors:</b> those that are sponsoring the applicants’ visas. Dependent on the scheme this could be – Welsh Government (Super Sponsor Scheme) or an individual (Homes for Ukraine Individual Scheme). Once a Visa has been granted, the sponsor will never change. The sponsor is linked directly to the applicant/application. A sponsor is often also the initial host for the applicant and where the sponsor is also the host they require two separate records. Sponsor details can be updated but the link between the sponsor and applicant/application cannot.</p>
                <p><b>Hosts: </b>those providing accommodation for an applicant irrespective of Homes for Ukraine route. The host is determined by where the applicant is currently housed (normally this is with the sponsor initially). This relationship between the host and applicant is transient and are linked through the placement record.</p>
                <p>Host and sponsor details are recorded in the same section of the data platform but are classified as either sponsor or host. Sponsor information comes into the Platform through the data imported from UK Government.</p>
                <h4>New Host Field</h4>
                <p>There is an added section on the household page which shows the host and host address fields. It is in this new section that you can:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>View all hosts attached to the household (where there are multiple applicants in the household it will show multiple sponsor records in the dropdown).</li>
                <li>Select the host you wish to be the active sponsor/host so that all duplications become inactive.</li>
                <li>The host can be selected by typing in their name or hitting enter on your keypad.  Once the host is selected, hit enter and the host address(es) will appear.</li>
                <img src="assets/images/new-host-field23.png" alt="">
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section id="deduplicating-sponsor" class="y-target">
                <h3>Deduplicating the Sponsor Records </h3>
                <h4>Households with only one applicant</h4>
                <p>As there should be no duplicated sponsor/hosts on households with a single applicant, only the following updates in the system will occur: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Existing records - </b>the host will be automatically copied to the new host field on the household page from the applicant.</li>
                    <li><b>For new data uploads - </b>the host will be automatically copied to the new host field on the household page when uploaded. </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Households with more than one applicant</h4>
                <p>These changes will only apply for existing households already in the system where there are multiple applicants, and each applicant has been linked to the sponsor/host separately causing multiple sponsor/host records to be created.  This change does not apply to new data.</p>
                <p>Example: 3 applicants linked to one host – Edward Jones.  In the system the sponsor/host will link separately to each applicant therefore creating duplicated records for the host</p>
                <h4 id="search-via-sponsor" class="y-target">Search via the sponsor tab</h4>
                <p>You will need to decide which sponsor record should remain the active record, to do this you can either:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Access the Sponsor record by going to the sponsor tab and clicking the ‘Active Sponsors’ View.</li>
                    <img src="assets/images/search-sponsor-tab23.png" alt="Image of sponsor tab in active sponsors view">
                    <li>From here you can search for the host in the top right-hand corner (in this example typing in Martin and hitting enter). </li>
                    <li>You will see multiple records for the same sponsor.</li>
                    <li>You may need to access each record to find the record with the most relevant information recorded. </li>
                    <li>Once you have established which record you intend to keep as active we recommend you annotate the record so you know which one to select (e.g. add a 1 to the forename / surname of the record</li>

                <h4>Search via the household tab</h4>
                <p>Alternatively, to find the Sponsor/host, you can search via the household tab:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the new ‘Active households and hosts’ system view on the household tab (which is available to all champions) and filter the number of approved applicants by ‘sort larger to smaller’. </li>
                    <p><b>View:</b></p>
                    <img src="assets/images/household-tab23.png" alt="Screenshot of active households and hosts">
                    <p><b>Sorting 'larger to smaller':</b></p>

                    <li>Click into the FAM ID, access the lead applicant page and go to the ‘personal details tab’ where you will see the host linked.</li>
                    <img src="assets/images/famid23.png" alt="Screenshot demonstrating FAM ID">
                    <li>Once you have established the sponsor for the household with multiple applicants, you can <a href="#search-via-sponsor">follow the process of accessing the sponsor tab and clicking the ‘active sponsors’ view.</a> </li>
                </ol>
                <h4>De-duplicating the records</h4>
                <p>Once you have completed the above steps, you can start the de-duplication process.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go into the household page and click into the host field and click ‘enter’. This will show the list of duplicated sponsors. </li>
                    <li>When searching for the correct sponsor/host record it will only show all duplicate records that have been linked to that applicant/household, it will not search all hosts under the same name. </li>
                    <li>Select the record you have previously added an annotation to ‘Martin1 Boyle / Carolyn2 Morgan’</li>
                    <li>Move to the host address tab and click ‘enter’ and select the host address associated to the Sponsor/Host.</li>
                    <li>By selecting this record, all the other duplicated records will then become inactive, and you will not be able to see them in the ‘active sponsors’ view.  </li>
                    <li>The only way to locate these records would be by searching for them in the ‘Inactive Sponsors’ view.</li>
                    <img src="assets/images/inactive-sponsors23.png" alt="Inactive Sponsors drop down">
                    <li>If any of the deactivated sponsor records are linked to placement tracking records, these will be replaced with the new active sponsor record.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>If you de-duplicate the wrong record</h4>
                <p>If you accidently choose the wrong host (selecting sponsor A1 instead of A2) you can either update the record to reflect the information on the inactivated record OR you can follow the steps below: </p>
                <li>Go to ‘Inactive Sponsors’ view. </li>
                <li>Locate the inactivated record (example: Sponsor A2).</li>
                <li>Activate the record (so now both Sponsor A1 and Sponsor A2 are active).</li>
                <li>Go to the household, click into the host field and replace the host from Sponsor A1 to Sponsor A2. </li>
                <li>Replace the host on the PT record to reflect the new host (sponsor A2) – to do this you need to:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Go into the placement type dropdown and select anything other than sponsor/host (e.g. temporary accommodation).</li>
                        <img src="assets/images/famtemp23.png" alt="Screenshot showing temporary accomodation selected from dropdown">
                        <li>Go back into the dropdown and re-select sponsor/host – this will pull through the updated host details </li>
                        <img src="assets/images/famhost23.png" alt="Screenshot showing Sponsor/Host selected from dropdown">
                    </ol>
                <li><b>You will need to update the host in the applicant placement tracking records – you can do this by simply deleting the sponsor and replacing with the correct sponsor record. </b></li>
                <li>Go the “Active sponsors” view.  </li>
                <li>Locate Sponsor A1, close any active placement tracking’s and change the sponsor/host journey status to HST006- Duplicate.  This will deactivate the record</li>
                <h4>Further Data Uploads</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>When data is uploaded of households with more than one applicant, one of the linked sponsor records will be selected and linked to the whole household.</li>
                    <li>Applicants who join the household after the initial creation will be linked to the household’s active host. </li>
                    <li>All other duplicate records will be de-activated. </li>
                    <li>The only way to locate these records would be by searching for them in the ‘Inactive Sponsors’ view.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><b>Information added to previously duplicated (and now inactive) sponsor records will not be merged into the chosen ‘active’ sponsor record.  It is important that you ensure the record with the correct and most up to date information is selected and any information held on duplicated inactive records is manually added to the active record, if appropriate.</b></p>
                <p><b>Changes will only be made to update existing households with more than one applicant </b></p>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>What is the purpose of the Data Platform?</h3>
            <p>The Data Platform facilitates secure access to an up to date, single source of data to those providing support to Ukrainian citizens coming into Wales.</p>
            <p>It helps provide an overview of all those entering Wales so that we can easily monitor and support individuals, as well as enable accurate reporting to Welsh Ministers and UK Government.</p>
            
            <h3>When was the Data Platform launched?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government launched the Data Platform in June 2022. The platform continues to benefit from monthly functionality improvements based on end user feedback. </p>
            
            <h3>Who has access to the Data Platform?</h3>
            <p>The organisations who currently have access to the Data Platform are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Welsh Government</li>
                <li>Digital Health and Care Wales</li>
                <li>National Contact Centre</li>
                <li>Local Authorities in Wales</li>
                <li>Public Health Wales</li>
                <li>Local Health Boards in Wales</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What are Accommodations?</h3>
            <p>Accommodations refer to initial accommodation provided to individuals who are coming to Wales under the Welsh Government Super Sponsorship Scheme, and there are a number across Wales. Some of these are often referred to as ‘Welcome Centres’ – generally because they will be exclusively used by Ukrainian guests and offer on-site provision of services. Welcome Centres are run by the local authority in the area they are located.</p>
            
            <h3>What is meant by "Initial Accommodation Staff’"?</h3>
            <p>Local Authority employees who are running the Initial Accommodation sites / Welcome Centres in their areas. Non-Local Authority Staff employed by the Welcome Centres are not included in this category.</p>
            
            <h3>What is the difference between a Sponsor and a Host?</h3>
            <p><b>Sponsors:</b> those that are sponsoring the applicants’ visas. Dependent on the scheme this could be – Welsh Government (Super Sponsor Scheme) or an individual (Homes for Ukraine Individual Scheme). Once a Visa has been granted, the sponsor will never change. The sponsor is linked directly to the applicant/application. A sponsor is often also the initial host for the applicant but does need a separate record. Sponsor details can be updated but the link between the sponsor and applicant/application cannot.</p>
            <p><b>Hosts:</b> those providing accommodation for an applicant irrespective of Homes for Ukraine route. The host is based on where the applicant is currently housed (normally this will be with the sponsor initially). This is transient and the host and applicant are linked through the placement record.</p>
            <p>Host and sponsor details are recorded in the same section of the data platform but are classified as either sponsor or host. Sponsor information comes into the Platform through the data imported from UK Government.</p>
        
            <h3>Will Initial Accommodation (sometimes referred to as Welcome Centre) sites have access to the Data Platform?</h3>
            <p>Third parties providing Initial Accommodation provision do not have access to the system. Only staff working in local authorities who are managing the Initial Accommodation / Welcome Centres have access.</p>

            <h3>What information will be available via the Data Platform?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Names, addresses and other key demographic information for Ukrainians, hosts and sponsors.</li>
                <li>Checks required and whether they have been completed</li>
                <li>Accommodation requirements</li>
                <li>Notes (this should not contain any medical or sensitive information)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>What information will not be available via the Data Platform?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Special Category Data (for example: Medical, political beliefs, sexual orientation, religious beliefs)</li>
                <li>Details of criminal offences/convictions (though we need to collect whether prospective hosts or sponsors have failed certain checks)</li>
                <li>Ongoing service provision (e.g. schools, social care)</li>
                <li>Capacity of Initial Accomodation</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>How are service incidents relating to the Data Platform handled?</h3>
            <p>User incidents are triaged by your organisation’s local service desk in the first instance, before a call is routed to the Data Platform service desk. Refer to the <a href="support-model.html">support model</a> for detailed information.</p>

            <p>You can access this direct from within the UDP by clicking the ‘?’ icon at the top righthand side of the application window.</p>
            <p>We have tried to make the user guide easier to navigate on the site and have added our new ‘bite size’ training videos to help with key aspects of using the platform. You can also find previous versions of our Newsletter and other helpful information on system updates.</p>

            <h3>I am unable to locate an applicant on the system.</h3>
            <p>If the applicant has had their visa approved but you cannot locate them on the system, their record may be assigned to another Local Authority. </p>
            <p>An ‘out of area search’ function is available to enable you to find basic information about any record within the platform, regardless of which local authority the record is assigned to.</p>
            <p>Find out how to use it at <a href="https://ukrainedataplatform.github.io/documentation/user-guide.html#searching-record-outside">Searching for a record outside of your local authority.</a></p>
            <p>If you still cannot locate the applicant in the system, please contact us through the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> and copy in <a href="mailto:data@gov.wales">data@gov.wales</a>data@gov.wales mailbox to seek further assistance.</p>

            <h3>I don’t feel confident using the system and would like more training, is this available?</h3>
            <p>We hope that the <a href="https://ukrainedataplatform.github.io/documentation/user-guide.html">User Guide</a> will contain everything you need to work your way through the platform.

            <h3>Why am I asked to keep my records up to date?</h3>
            <p>The platform is designed to show the true picture of how we are supporting all Ukrainians seeking sanctuary in Wales. You and your colleagues in local authorities and local health boards all rely on access to accurate records relating to the individuals you are responsible for. Keeping records in the platform up to date is important because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The data within the platform is used to report to the UK Government every quarter.</li>
                <li>Incorrect data could result in incorrect funding for the services you have provided.</li>
                <li>Multiple stakeholders are drawing information from the platform to inform future policy decisions. If the data is not correct, this may have a negative effect on decision making.</li>
                <li>Health boards will primarily use the system to trace people who they have lost contact with and for identifying provision and direct of future support. Healthcare services and individual patient outcomes could be affected if records are not up to date.</li>
                <li>We need it to be up to date to ensure we are communicating with all hosts in Wales, and not just those who acted as sponsors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is imperative that everyone using the platform ensures their records are up to date, accurate and assigned to the correct local authority.</p>

            <h3>How can I ensure that I keep all my records up to date?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ensure every household/applicant has a placement record that reflects where they have stayed in Wales. This may be one or more records. Placement records are used to calculate how long guests have either been in host accommodations or initial accommodation</li>
                <li>Complete all household/applicant checks to ensure local support services have been accessed.</li>
                <li>Ensure all host contact information is available on their record.</li>
                <li>Complete suitability checks on all sponsors/hosts and any relevant members of their own household and their accommodation.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Are WG doing anything to support LAs to keep their records up to date?</h3>
            <p>We have developed a new system view in the platform which will show applicant records that do not have an active placement record. We hope this will help you to target your efforts in completing this information and fulfilling your data management responsibilities under GDPR. In addition, the existing user guide shows you how to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete Welcome Centre Checks for new arrivals</li>
                <li>Follow the steps to manage new arrivals on the Super Sponsor route and the Individual Sponsor route</li>
                <li>Open and close placement records</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can also attend one of our bi-weekly drop-in sessions, send us an email or contact your fellow platform users. Contact us if you do not have the ‘platform user community’ contact list. </p>

            <h3>As a data champion, how often should I use and access the platform?</h3>
            <p>There is an expectation for data champions and other Local Authority users to frequently access the data platform. This ensures that data is monitored correctly and kept up to date. Failure to access the system on a regular basis can result in a back log of up-to-date records. </p>

            <h3>What is a data champion and what are their roles and responsibilities?</h3>
            <p>Data Champions play a key role in ensuring the Data Platform is actively and effectively used within their organisations. Due to the sensitive nature of the data held on the platform, Champions are also gatekeepers within their organisation, ensuring access is only provided to those that need it.</p>
            <p>Data Champions have the same access to the platform as other local users but have a deeper understanding of the system, enabling them to provide advice and training to colleagues.</p>
            <p>Data Champion responsibilities include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Determining who requires access to the Data Platform within their organisation and submitting requests as required.</li>
                <li>Nominating and validating requests for new local Champions, using the template provided.</li>
                <li>Championing the use and best practice of the Ukraine Data Platform.</li>
                <li>Providing training and guidance to new users within their organisation.</li>
                <li>Act as contact point between users within their organisation and the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> mailbox Mailbox.</li>
                <li>Attend drop-in sessions to exchange information on the Data Platform’s current releases.</li>
                <li>Feedback suggestions for improvements and changes in Data Platform functionality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How do I nominate a new / remove a data champion?</h3>
            <p>To make a request to add / remove a data champion (or any user) you will need to contact the <a href="mailto:nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales">nationofsanctuarysurvey@gov.wales</a> Mailbox.  This request should always come from an existing data champion within your authority.</p>
            <p>When sending the Data Platform team your nomination for a new local Data Champion, please use the following form of words in your email:</p>
            <p>"I can confirm that I have trained [new Champion’s full name] on how to use the Data Platform and that they have access to the User Guide to support their on-going use of the system. Please register them as a Data Champion for [name of organisation]."</p>

            <h3>How often should users access the platform?</h3>
            <p>If a user doesn’t access the data platform for more than 30 days they will be flagged as inactive and their account will be disabled. </p>

            <h3>Has the Data Platform undergone accessibility testing?</h3>
            <p>Accessibility specialists assessed the visual and functional accessibility of the Data Platform and provided advice to the development team on identified issues. All identified issues have been remediated.</p>
           
            <h3>Will the Data Platform be bilingual?</h3>
            <p>The Data Platform is currently not bilingual as there is not a Welsh language pack for the development tool. We continue to explore cost effective ways to achieve a bilingual solution.</p>

            
            <h3>Will data continue to be provided via Objective Connect once the Data Platform goes live?</h3>
            <p>Objective Connect is now switched off for many of the Ukraine Data feeds. Data is now available through system views and Excel templates within the Ukraine Data Platform.</p>
            
            <h3>Is there a mechanism for exporting data?</h3>
            <p>Users can download / export data from the data platform into csv / xls formats.</p>
            
            <h3 class="nonbold">Is data sharing via the Platform already covered by the <a href="http://www.waspi.org/participating-organisations">Wales Accord on the Sharing of Personal Information</a> (WASPI)?</h3>
            <p>A WASPI assured Information Sharing Protocol is available to cover all data sharing and has been issued to all Local Authorities and Health Boards for sign off. </p>
            
            <h3>Who is the Data Controller for the data?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government along with Local Authorities and Health Boards are all independent data controllers.</p>
           
            <h3>Has a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) been carried out?</h3>
            <p>As a data controller Welsh Government has conducted a DPIA to help us identify and minimise any data protection risks.</p>
            <p>The DPIA covers the processing of the personal data, rather than the actual system. However, the DPIA references how the Data Platform prevents unauthorised or inappropriate access to the data.</p>
            <p>The DPIA is kept under regular review to ensure it continues to reflect the situation and any changes in data flows.</p>
            
            <h3>Do Local Authorities and Local Health Boards need to carry out their own Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)?</h3>
            <p>As independent data controllers, it will be for local authorities and local health boards to determine whether they need their own DPIAs. The Welsh Government DPIA has been shared with all partners and may be used as a guide if appropriate.</p>
            
            <h3>Are new data sharing agreements required?</h3>
            <p>A comprehensive Information Sharing Protocol (ISP), covering the data platform and all Ukraine related data flows between the Welsh Government, local authorities, and the NHS has been developed and formally assured by WASPI. The majority of partners have signed and returned the agreement – if you are unsure whether your organisation has signed the ISP we recommend contacting your Data Champion or Data Protection Officer in the first instance. Subsequently, if you are still unsure please contact <a href="mailto:data@gov.wales">data@gov.wales</a> with the subject line ‘Ukraine ISP’.</p>
         
            
            <h3>Do Local Authorities and Health Boards require a joint Data Sharing Agreement?</h3>
            <p>If local authorities and local health boards determine they are joint data controllers they are required to have a transparent arrangement that sets out their agreed roles and responsibilities for complying with the UK GDPR.</p>
            <p>However, if it is determined that they are processing the same data for different purposes they are not classed as joint controllers and no joint agreement is required.</p>
            
            <h3>Are there any data processors?</h3>
            <p>Digital Health and Care Wales and the Contact Centre are all data processors. Welcome Centre locations may also be data processors, but this is determined by the Local Authority for that location.</p>
            
            <h3>Are there agreements in place with the data processors?</h3>
            <p>There is already an agreement in place between Welsh Government and the contact centre. This will be reviewed and updated, if necessary, to ensure the data being processed on the Data Platform is fully covered.</p>
            <p>A Memorandum of Understanding and GDPR schedule between Welsh Government and Digital Health and Care Wales has been agreed and signed by both parties. This agreement will be reviewed to unsure it is kept up to date and reflects the current data sharing arrangements.</p>
            <p>Local Authorities are responsible for arrangements with their respective processors, including welcome centres, if required. </p>
            
            <h3>Are new privacy notices required?</h3>
            <p>Welsh Government will regularly review our existing privacy notices with regards to this data to ensure it is up to date and accurate. </p>
            <p>All data controllers and processors are advised to consider whether they need specific Ukraine related privacy notices in place to reflect the operational functions being carried out by their individual organisations. </p>
            
            <h3>Has the Information Commissioner’s Office been engaged on this work?</h3>
            <p>We informally engaged with the ICO’s office in Wales during the development of the data platform and they were supportive of the initiative. Due to the nature of this data sharing, the Information Commissioner’s Office has not been formally consulted. The introduction of the Data Platform will not change but will simplify and improve access to the data already being shared.</p>

            <h2>Policy Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>When does Wales’ ‘Duty of Care’ end for a Ukrainian if they return to Ukraine but decide to come back to Wales within the terms of the visa?</h3>
            <p>The Homes for Ukraine funding tariff is only available for the first 12 months after initial arrival. If someone goes and comes back during that 12 months, local authorities are expected to provide the same level of support as before. If the return happens after the 12 months, then, at present, we recognise that there is no funding to support an enhanced local authority service so mainstream services may have to be what is on offer.</p>
            <p>Welsh Government (as a sponsor for the super sponsor beneficiaries) has committed to providing 6 months accommodation (as with all sponsors). If someone on the Super Sponsor route left initial accommodation before 1 December 2022 and returns within 6 months to their initial accommodation, we will aim to fulfil our initial offer of up to 6 months accommodation. This offer would end 6 months after their initial arrival in the UK, rather than 6 months from their return to the UK.</p>
            <p>If someone leaves initial accommodation from 1 December 2022 onwards, they will be permitted only two weeks absence at a time (or a maximum of four weeks absence during their time in initial accommodation) before we may withdraw our offer of accommodation. </p>
            <p>If someone is post-6 months initial arrival or if they are on the Homes for Ukraine individual sponsor route, the local authority has homelessness duties which may need to be engaged. We are still exploring how we will support those who remain in our initial accommodation when they reach the six-month mark after initial arrival in the UK.</p>

            <h3>A Ukrainian is self-sufficient as they have found their own accommodation and job. If this situation changes would the Local Authority need to provide support again?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Ukrainians have a right to Local Authority homelessness assistance for the duration of their three year visa. Within the Platform we would still expect the individual’s most recently known placement to be recorded, even if no further support is expected. These individuals should be set to Move on (IS05/ SS10) with the status reason as ‘self-supporting’.  Should these individuals return and receive the support from the Local Authority, their journey status and reason should be updated to reflect their new situation i.e. IS02 placed with a host family</p>

            <h3>If a Ukrainian leaves for more than 2 weeks and we release the room/accommodation, what happens if they return?</h3>
            <p>Two weeks is the standard time we are working towards before a room is reallocated. It’s recommended that a courtesy call is made to say the room is being reallocated but unless the current occupant explains they will be back within a reasonable amount of time, we need to have the room reallocated. The likelihood is that people may have left belongings in the room so the venue will need to try to contact the absent occupiers to discuss what will happen with those belongings regardless. If the individuals wish to return after this time, they should contact the Nation of Sanctuary Contact Centre, who will assess whether they are still eligible for support and re-allocate other initial accommodation, as required.</p>

            <h3>At which point are Local Authorities no longer responsible for a Ukrainian that has travelled to live in Wales? Is there a cut off point for returning on both the scheme and Visa? </h3>
            <p>During the three years of the Homes for Ukraine visa, the Ukrainian is eligible for support to live, work and claim Public Funds in the UK. During the first 12 months, the local authority is also able to claim additional Homes for Ukraine funds to provide enhanced services. Details are being established about funding support in the second year of the scheme.</p>
            <p>Homes for Ukraine visas have now cut off / void period due to absences from the UK. </p>

            <h3>What are the funding implications if they are away for more than two weeks?</h3>
            <p>The Welsh Government continues to receive funding for this person even during absence. The funding agreements we have in place with Local Authorities for wraparound support is not always tied to the number of people accommodated on any given day. However, where that is the case, the funding for that person would stop if the room were not reallocated.</p>

            <h3>Should the Local Authority trace people when they unexpectantly leave Initial Accommodation?</h3>
            <p>The Local Authority’s responsibility is to inform the Contact Centre that someone has not returned. The Contact Centre will try to trace them and record them as missing, if appropriate.</p>

            <h3>Should a baby born to a Ukrainian family, which has travelled under the Super Sponsor or Individual Sponsor route, be added to the Data Platform? </h3>
            <p> “A child who is a Ukrainian national, or who is born in the UK after 18 March and has Ukrainian national parents, is eligible for leave to remain under the Ukraine extension scheme. Where the 18 March date is not relevant, there is provision for a child born in the UK to Ukraine parents who had leave to be in the UK before 1 January which has expired.” (Source: Home Office)</p>
            <p>In terms of whether they need to be added to the UDP, the answer is ‘no.’ Our rationale for the UDP data is that individuals are on Homes for Ukraine and we need to know their whereabouts and services for safeguarding assurance and financial reporting to ensure services are provided effectively – but that doesn’t apply where the Ukraine Extension Scheme is the visa held (there is no Integration Tariff available in those circumstances). That being said, it would be helpful to all involved to ensure a case note is added to relevant individuals’ records to show that they have additional dependent children who are not recorded on the UDP.</p>

            <h3>What happens to payments following the end of the initial schemes – will they be extended?</h3>
            <p>There is no plan to extend payments beyond the 12 month post-arrival period. UK Government has confirmed that a Housing support fund will be available in the second year of the scheme but details are still being established and the fund is unlikely to be apportioned equally to all Homes for Ukraine visa holders. </p>

            <h3>What happens when a sponsor is no longer willing to host the applicant?</h3>
            <p>In this instance the status of sponsor/host should be recorded as withdrawn on the data platform and a case note added to the applicants record to explain the situation. Although a Jira ticket can be raised in this situation, if the visa has already been granted the applicant already has the rights to come to the UK. Recommended steps would be:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Local Authority of the withdrawn sponsor/host to contact the applicant to offer them an alternative vetted host as an option </li>
                <li>Alternatively, you may be able to advise the applicant to join the Reset database to look for a rematch </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What is the Difference between Re-matches and Re-assignments?</h3>
            <p>There are key differences between the terms Re-match and Re-assignment, please see below definitions:</p>
            <p><b>Re-matching</b> is the process of a visa holder finding or being found a new accommodation placement. This can be in the form of a hosted placement or private rental placement. Re-matching can happen in lots of scenarios, including because of hosting breakdown, the scheduled end of a host placement, movement to another area for various reasons, or movement from Initial Accommodation (also known as ‘Move On’). In the context of the Ukraine Data Platform, re-matching involves the process of ending on placement and creating the follow-up placement tracking record.</p>
            <p><b>Adverse hit re-sponsoring</b> is the process of a visa applicant being matched with a secondary sponsor for their application after their initial sponsor was rejected during checks. Rejection through these checks is called an ‘Adverse Hit’. Rather than refuse the visa application, the UK Government’s policy is to offer the applicant an opportunity to find a secondary sponsor who can support the application. If that sponsor passes the checks, the visa will be granted and the visa holder will be able to travel to the UK. In the Ukraine Data Platform, we will flag the failed sponsors to ensure these are known to the relevant local authority. This is to ensure failed sponsors are not given the opportunity to become hosts. Becoming a host includes a DBS check and property inspection but does not include a check of the Police National Computer or Home Office Warnings Index. The UDP flag therefore provides additional safeguarding assurance.</p>
            <p><b>Re-assignment</b> is the process of ensuring visa holder records transfer from one local authority to another, as a result of a rematch into a new area. The Ukraine Data Platform does not permit full access to all records for every local authority. Only the local authority can view records of those linked to their area. Therefore, if a visa holder moves to a new local authority a re-assignment process must take place to ensure data transfers appropriately. The purpose of this is to ensure visa holders are properly safeguarding and supported in their new area and to ensure financial support is properly allocated between local authorities for the delivery of public services.</p>
            <p><b>Cross-border re-assignment</b> this is a type of re-assignment where visa holders move from one nation of the UK to another. Wales, Scotland and England/NI use different data platforms to store and process data relating to visa holders in each nation. As a result, there is a more complex process for ensuring records are appropriately allocated when visa holders move across a national boundary. For Wales, the Wales Nation of Sanctuary contact centre acts as the intermediary between Welsh local authorities and local authorities in other parts of the UK. They can help to process cross-border re-assignments correctly.</p>
